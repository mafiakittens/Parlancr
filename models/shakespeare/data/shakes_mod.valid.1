lie thou there ( throwing down a letter ) , for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling .
maria once told me she did affect me , and i have heard herself come thus near , that , should she fancy , it should be one of my complexion .
besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her .
what should i think on ' t ?
to be count malvolio !
the lady of the strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him .
i frown the while , and perchance wind up watch , or play with my , some rich jewel .
"lips , do not move ; no man must know . """
"no man must know . "" what follows ?"
"no man must know . "" if this should be thee , malvolio ?"
i may command where i adore , but silence , like a lucrece knife , with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore ; m . o . a . i .
"doth sway my life . "" nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see ."
"i may command where i adore . "" why , she may command me ."
why , this is evident to any formal capacity .
there is no obstruction in this .
if i could make that resemble something in me , softly !
there is a fair behavior in thee , captain , and though that nature with a beauteous wall doth oft close in pollution , yet of thee i will believe thou hast a mind that suits with this thy fair and outward character .
i prithee , and i'll pay thee bounteously , conceal me what i am , and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent .
i'll serve this duke .
thou shall present me as an eunuch to him .
it may be worth thy pains , for i can sing and speak to him in many sorts of music that will allow me very worth his service .
be you his eunuch , and your mute i'll be .
when my tongue blabs , then let mine eyes not see .
i thank thee .
lead me on .
"m "" , malvolio ."
"m "" , why , that begins my name ."
"m . o . a . i . "" this simulation is not as the former , and yet to crush this a little , it would bow to me , for every one of these letters are in my name ."
soft , here follows prose .
if this fall into thy hand , revolve .
in my stars i am above thee , but be not afraid of greatness .
some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon ' em .
thy fates open their hands .
let thy blood and spirit embrace them .
and , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh .
i say , remember .
farewell .
"she that would alter services with thee , the fortunate unhappy "" daylight and champaign discovers not more ."
this is open .
i will be proud , i will read politic authors , i will baffle sir toby , i will wash off gross acquaintance , i will be point - devise the very man .
i do not now fool myself , to let imagination jade me , for every reason excites to this , that my lady loves me .
she did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross-gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking .
i thank my stars i am happy .
i will be strange , stout , in yellow stockings , and cross-gartered , even with the swiftness of putting on .
jove and my stars be praised !
here is yet a postscript .
thou canst not choose but know who i am .
if thou entertainest my love , let it appear in thy smiling .
thy smiles become thee well .
"therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , i prithee . """
jove , i thank thee !
i will do everything that thou wilt have me .
i will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the sophy .
i could marry this wench for this device .
so could i too .
and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .
nor i neither .
here comes my noble gull-catcher .
wilt thou set thy foot o ' my neck ?
or o ' mine either ?
shall i play my freedom at tray-trip , and become thy bondslave ?
i ' faith , or i either ?
why , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
like aqua vitae with a midwife .
if you will see it , follow me .
to the gates of tartar , thou most excellent devil of wit !
i'll make one too .
save thee , friend , and thy music .
dost thou live by thy tabour ?
no , sir , i live by the church .
art thou a churchman ?
so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him , or the church stands by thy tabor , if thy tabor stand by the church .
you have said , sir .
how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward !
nay , that's certain .
i would therefore my sister had no name , sir .
why , man ?
why , sir , her name's a word , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton .
thy reason , man ?
troth , sir , i can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , i am loath to prove reason with them .
i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
not so , sir , i do care for something .
but in my conscience , sir , i do not care for you .
if that be to care for nothing , sir , i would it would make you invisible .
art not thou the lady olivia's fool ?
no , indeed , sir ; the lady olivia has no folly .
i saw thee late at the count orsino's .
it shines everywhere .
i would be sorry , sir , but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress : i think i saw your wisdom there .
hold , there's expenses for thee .
now jove , in his next commodity of hair , send thee a beard !
to fool ) is thy lady within ?
yes , being kept together and put to use .
my lady is within , sir .
i will construe to them whence you come .
"who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , i might say "" element , "" but the word is overworn ."
this fellow is wise enough to play the fool , and to do that well craves a kind of wit .
this is a practise as full of labor as a wise man's art , for folly that he wisely shows is fit .
save you , gentleman .
and you , sir .
i am bound to your niece , sir .
i mean , she is the list of my voyage .
taste your legs , sir .
put them to motion .
i mean , to go , sir , to enter .
i will answer you with gait and entrance .
but we are prevented .
most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you !
my matter hath no voice , lady , but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear .
em all three all ready .
let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
give me your hand , sir .
my duty , madam , and most humble service .
what is your name ?
cesario is your servant's name , fair princess .
my servant , sir !
twas never merry world since lowly feigning was call'd compliment .
for him , i think not on him .
for his thoughts , would they were blanks , rather than fill'd with me .
madam , i come to whet your gentle thoughts on his behalf .
o , by your leave , i pray you , i bade you never speak again of him .
dear lady , give me leave , beseech you .
i did send , after the last enchantment you did here , a ring in chase of you .
what might you think ?
what a plague means my niece , to take the death of her brother thus ?
by my troth , sir toby , you must come in earlier o ' nights .
your cousin , my lady , takes great exceptions to your ill hours .
why , let her except , before excepted .
i'll confine myself no finer than i am .
these clothes are good enough to drink in , and so be these boots too .
an they be not , let them hang themselves in their own straps .
who , sir andrew aguecheek ?
ay , he .
he's as tall a man as any ' s in illyria .
have you not set mine honor at the stake , and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts that tyrannous heart can think ?
to one of your receiving enough is shown .
so , let me hear you speak .
i pity you .
that's a degree to love .
no , not a grize .
if one should be a prey , how much the better to fall before the lion than the wolf !
there lies your way , due west .
stay , i prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
that you do think you are not what you are .
if i think so , i think the same of you .
i would you were as i would have you be !
would it be better , madam , than i am ?
i wish it might , for now i am your fool .
and so adieu , good madam .
no , faith , i'll not stay a jot longer .
thy reason , dear venom , give thy reason .
you must needs yield your reason , sir andrew .
marry , i saw your niece do more favors to the count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me .
i saw ' t i ' the orchard .
did she see thee the while , old boy ?
tell me that .
as plain as i see you now .
this was a great argument of love in her toward you .
slight , will you make an ass o ' me ?
i will prove it legitimate , sir , upon the oaths of judgment and reason .
and they have been grand-jurymen since before noah was a sailor .
she did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valor , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver .
you should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire-new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
this was looked for at your hand , and this was balked .
an ' t be any way , it must be with valor , for policy i hate .
i had as lief be a brownist as a politician .
why , then , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor .
challenge me the count's youth to fight with him .
hurt him in eleven places .
my niece shall take note of it , and assure thyself , there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valor .
there is no way but this , sir andrew .
will either of you bear me a challenge to him ?
go , write it in a martial hand .
be curst and brief .
it is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and full of invention .
go .
this is a dear manikin to you , sir toby .
i have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
we shall have a rare letter from him : but you'll not deliver ' t ?
never trust me , then .
and by all means stir on the youth to an answer .
i think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together .
look where the youngest wren of nine comes .
if you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
he's in yellow stockings .
and cross-gartered ?
most villanously , like a pedant that keeps a school i ' the church .
he does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the indies .
you have not seen such a thing as ' tis .
i can hardly forbear hurling things at him .
i know my lady will strike him .
if she do , he'll smile and take ' t for a great favor .
come , bring us , bring us where he is .
i could not stay behind you .
my kind antonio , i can no other answer make but thanks , and thanks , and ever thanks .
what's to do ?
shall we go see the relics of this town ?
belike you slew great number of his people ?
it might have since been answered in repaying what we took from them , which , for traffic's sake , most of our city did .
only myself stood out ; for which , if i be lapsed in this place , i shall pay dear .
do not then walk too open .
it doth not fit me .
hold , sir , here's my purse .
haply your eye shall light upon some toy you have desire to purchase , and your store , i think , is not for idle markets , sir .
i'll be your purse-bearer and leave you for an hour .
to the elephant .
i do remember .
i have sent after him .
he says he'll come .
for youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow'd .
i speak too loud . , where's malvolio ?
he is sad and civil and suits well for a servant with my fortunes .
where is malvolio ?
he's coming , madam ; but in very strange manner .
he is sure possessed , madam .
why , what's the matter ?
does he rave ?
no , madam , he does nothing but smile .
your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come , for sure the man is tainted in ' s wits .
go call him hither .
i am as mad as he , if sad and merry madness equal be .
how now , malvolio ?
sweet lady , ho , ho .
why , he has three thousand ducats a year .
he's a very fool and a prodigal .
fie , that you'll say so !
by this hand , they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him .
who are they ?
they that add , moreover , he's drunk nightly in your company .
with drinking healths to my niece .
i'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in illyria .
he's a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o ' th ' toe like a parish top .
sir toby belch !
how now , sir toby belch !
sweet sir andrew !
smilest thou ?
i sent for thee upon a sad occasion .
sad , lady !
i could be sad .
this does make some obstruction in the blood , this cross-gartering , but what of that ?
"if it please the eye of one , it is with me as the very true sonnet is , "" please one , and please all . "" why , how dost thou , man ?"
what is the matter with thee ?
not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs .
it did come to his hands , and commands shall be executed .
i think we do know the sweet roman hand .
wilt thou go to bed , malvolio ?
to bed ?
how do you , malvolio ?
at your request !
yes , nightingales answer daws !
why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady ?
"be not afraid of greatness . "" ' t was well writ ."
what meanest thou by that , malvolio ?
"some are born great , """
ha ?
"some achieve greatness , "" what sayest thou ?"
"and some have greatness thrust upon them . "" heaven restore thee !"
"remember who commended thy yellow stockings , "" thy yellow stockings ?"
"and wished to see thee cross-gartered . "" cross-gartered ?"
"go to , thou art made , if thou desirest to be so , "" am i made ?"
madam , the young gentleman of the count orsino's is returned .
i'll come to him .
good maria , let this fellow be looked to .
where's my cousin toby ?
let some of my people have a special care of him .
i would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
oh , ho !
do you come near me now ?
this concurs directly with the letter .
"cast thy humble slough , "" says she ."
i have limed her , but it is jove's doing , and jove make me thankful !
"and when she went away now , "" let this fellow be looked to . "" "" fellow ! "" not "" malvolio , "" nor after my degree , but "" fellow . "" why , everything adheres together , that no dram of a scruple , no scruple of a scruple , no obstacle , no incredulous or unsafe circumstance , what can be said ?"
nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes .
well , jove , not i , is the doer of this , and he is to be thanked .
if all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and legion himself possessed him , yet i'll speak to him .
here he is , here he is .
how is't with you , sir ?
go off , i discard you .
let me enjoy my private .
go off .
aha !
does she so ?
do you know what you say ?
marry , and it shall be done tomorrow morning if i live .
my lady would not lose him for more than i'll say .
how now , mistress ?
o lord !
no way but gentleness , gently , gently .
the fiend is rough and will not be roughly used .
sir !
ay , biddy , come with me . , what , man !
tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with satan .
hang him , foul collier !
get him to say his prayers , good sir toby , get him to pray .
my prayers , minx ?
go , hang yourselves all !
you are idle , shallow things .
i am not of your element .
you shall know more hereafter .
is ' t possible ?
if this were played upon a stage now , i could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
his very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
why , we shall make him mad indeed .
the house will be the quieter .
come , we'll have him in a dark room and bound .
my niece is already in the belief that he's mad .
more matter for a may morning .
is ' t so saucy ?
ay , is ' t , i warrant him .
do but read .
give me .
a good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
very brief , and to exceeding good sense , less .
good .
still you keep o ' the windy side of the law .
good .
"andrew aguecheek """
if this letter move him not , his legs can not .
i'll give ' t him .
you may have very fit occasion for ' t .
he is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart .
go , sir andrew .
scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily .
away !
nay , let me alone for swearing .
his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less .
therefore this letter , being so excellently ignorant , will breed no terror in the youth .
he will find it comes from a clodpole .
but , sir , i will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon aguecheek a notable report of valor , and drive the gentleman ( as i know his youth will aptly receive it ) into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity .
this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
here he comes with your niece .
give them way till he take leave , and presently after him .
i will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge .
with the same ' havior that your passion bears goes on my master's grief .
here , wear this jewel for me .
tis my picture .
refuse it not .
it hath no tongue to vex you .
and i beseech you come again tomorrow .
what shall you ask of me that i'll deny , that honor , saved , may upon asking give ?
nothing but this : your true love for my master .
how with mine honor may i give him that which i have given to you ?
i will acquit you .
well , come again tomorrow .
fare thee well .
a fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
gentleman , god save thee .
and you , sir .
that defense thou hast , betake thee to ' t .
of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , i know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the orchard end .
dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skillful and deadly .
you mistake , sir .
i am sure no man hath any quarrel to me .
my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man .
you'll find it otherwise , i assure you .
i pray you , sir , what is he ?
he is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl .
souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre .
hob , nob , is his word .
and you too , sir .
accost , sir andrew , accost .
what's that ?
good mistress accost , i desire better acquaintance .
my name is mary , sir .
by my troth , i would not undertake her in this company .
"is that the meaning of "" accost "" ?"
an thou let part so , sir andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
an you part so , mistress , i would i might never draw sword again .
fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand ?
sir , i have not you by the hand .
i will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady .
i am no fighter .
i have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor .
belike this is a man of that quirk .
sir , no .
his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury .
therefore get you on and give him his desire .
back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him .
this is as uncivil as strange .
i beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is .
it is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
i will do so .
signior fabian , stay you by this gentleman till my return .
pray you , sir , do you know of this matter ?
i beseech you , what manner of man is he ?
he is , indeed , sir , the most skillful , bloody , and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of illyria .
will you walk towards him ?
i will make your peace with him if i can .
i shall be much bound to you for ' t .
why , man , he's a very devil .
i have not seen such a firago .
i had a pass with him , rapier , scabbard , and all , and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion , that it is inevitable .
and on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .
they say he has been fencer to the sophy .
pox on ' t !
i'll not meddle with him .
ay , but he will not now be pacified .
fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
plague on ' t , an i thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence , i'd have seen him damned ere i'd have challenged him .
let him let the matter slip , and i'll give him my horse , gray capilet .
i'll make the motion .
stand here , make a good show on ' t .
this shall end without the perdition of souls .
i'll ride your horse as well as i ride you .
he is as horribly conceited of him , and pants and looks pale , as if a bear were at his heels .
come , sir andrew , there's no remedy .
the gentleman will , for his honor's sake , have one bout with you .
he can not by the duello avoid it .
but he has promised me , as he is a gentleman and a soldier , he will not hurt you .
come on , to ' t .
pray god , he keep his oath !
i do assure you , ' tis against my will .
put up your sword .
if this young gentleman have done offence , i take the fault on me .
if you offend him , i for him defy you .
you , sir ?
why , what are you ?
one , sir , that for his love dares yet do more than you have heard him brag to you he will .
nay , if you be an undertaker , i am for you .
o good sir toby , hold !
here come the officers .
marry , will i , sir .
and for that i promised you , i'll be as good as my word .
he will bear you easily and reins well .
this is the man .
do thy office .
antonio , i arrest thee at the suit of count orsino .
you do mistake me , sir .
no , sir , no jot .
i know your favor well , though now you have no sea-cap on your head . , take him away .
he knows i know him well .
i must obey .
you stand amazed , but be of comfort .
come , sir , away .
what money , sir ?
i'll make division of my present with you .
hold , there's half my coffer .
will you deny me now ?
i hate ingratitude more in a man than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , or any taint of vice whose strong corruption inhabits our frail blood , o heavens themselves !
come , sir , i pray you , go .
let me speak a little .
away !
but oh , how vile an idol proves this god !
none can be called deformed but the unkind .
virtue is beauty , but the beauteous evil are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil .
the man grows mad .
away with him .
lead me on .
methinks his words do from such passion fly , that he believes himself .
so do not i .
prove true , imagination , oh , prove true , that i , dear brother , be now ta'en for you !
come hither , knight .
come hither , fabian .
we'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws .
he named sebastian .
still in this fashion , color , ornament , for him i imitate .
oh , if it prove , tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love !
a very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare .
his dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him .
and for his cowardship , ask fabian .
a coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
slid , i'll after him again and beat him .
an i do not , come , let's see the event .
i dare lay any money ' twill be nothing yet .
let me be clear of thee .
well held out , i ' faith .
no , i do not know you , nor i am not sent to you by my lady , to bid you come speak with her , nor your name is not master cesario , nor this is not my nose neither .
nothing that is so is so .
i prithee , vent thy folly somewhere else .
thou know'st not me .
vent my folly ?
he has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool .
vent my folly !
i am afraid this great lubber , the world , will prove a cockney .
i prithee now , ungird thy strangeness and tell me what i shall vent to my lady .
shall i vent to her that thou art coming ?
i prithee , foolish greek , depart from me .
there's money for thee .
by my troth , thou hast an open hand .
these wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report , after fourteen years ' purchase .
hold , sir , or i'll throw your dagger o'er the house .
nay , let him alone .
i'll go another way to work with him .
i'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in illyria .
though i struck him first , yet it's no matter for that .
come , sir , i will not let you go .
come , my young soldier , put up your iron .
you are well fleshed .
come on .
i will be free from thee .
what wouldst thou now ?
if thou darest tempt me further , draw thy sword .
what , what ?
nay , then i must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you .
hold , toby !
on thy life i charge thee , hold !
madam !
will it be ever thus ?
out of my sight ! , be not offended , dear cesario . , rudesby , be gone !
thou shalt not choose but go .
do not deny .
beshrew his soul for me !
he started one poor heart of mine in thee .
wherefore , sweetheart ?
why , i think so .
i am not such an ass , but i can keep my hand dry .
but what's your jest ?
a dry jest , sir .
are you full of them ?
marry , now i let go your hand , i am barren .
o knight , thou lackest a cup of canary .
when did i see thee so put down ?
never in your life , i think , unless you see canary put me down .
methinks sometimes i have no more wit than a christian or an ordinary man has .
if it be thus to dream , still let me sleep !
nay , come , i prithee .
would thou'dst be ruled by me !
madam , i will .
oh , say so , and so be !
nay , i prithee , put on this gown and this beard .
make him believe thou art sir topas the curate .
do it quickly .
i'll call sir toby the whilst .
the competitors enter .
jove bless thee , master parson .
bonos dies , sir toby .
to him , sir topas .
the knave counterfeits well .
a good knave .
sir topas , sir topas , good sir topas , go to my lady , out , hyperbolical fiend !
how vexest thou this man !
talkest thou nothing but of ladies ?
fie , thou dishonest satan !
i call thee by the most modest terms , for i am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy .
sayest thou that house is dark ?
as hell , sir topas .
why , it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes , and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony .
and yet complainest thou of obstruction ?
i am not mad , sir topas .
i say to you this house is dark .
madman , thou errest .
i say , there is no darkness but ignorance , in which thou art more puzzled than the egyptians in their fog .
i say , this house is as dark as ignorance , though ignorance were as dark as hell .
i am no more mad than you are .
make the trial of it in any constant question .
what is the opinion of pythagoras concerning wildfowl ?
that the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird .
what thinkest thou of his opinion ?
i think nobly of the soul , and no way approve his opinion .
fare thee well .
remain thou still in darkness .
thou shalt hold the opinion of pythagoras ere i will allow of thy wits , and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam .
fare thee well .
sir topas , sir topas !
my most exquisite sir topas !
nay , i am for all waters .
thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown .
he sees thee not .
to him in thine own voice , and bring me word how thou findest him .
i would we were well rid of this knavery .
if he may be conveniently delivered , i would he were , for i am now so far in offense with my niece that i can not pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot .
come by and by to my chamber .
fool !
fool !
fool , i say !
good fool , as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand , help me to a candle , and pen , ink , and paper .
as i am a gentleman , i will live to be thankful to thee for ' t .
master malvolio ?
ay , good fool .
but as well ?
then you are mad indeed , if you be no better in your wits than a fool .
sir topas !
fool , fool , fool , i say !
alas , sir , be patient .
what say you sir ?
good fool , help me to some light and some paper .
i tell thee , i am as well in my wits as any man in illyria .
well-a-day that you were , sir .
by this hand , i am .
good fool , some ink , paper , and light , and convey what i will set down to my lady .
it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did .
i will help you to ' t .
but tell me true , are you not mad indeed ?
or do you but counterfeit ?
believe me , i am not .
i tell thee true .
nay , i'll ne'er believe a madman till i see his brains .
i will fetch you light , and paper , and ink .
fool , i'll requite it in the highest degree .
i prithee , be gone .
this is the air , that is the glorious sun .
where's antonio , then ?
i could not find him at the elephant .
yet there he was , and there i found this credit , that he did range the town to seek me out .
his counsel now might do me golden service .
there's something in ' t that is deceivable .
but here the lady comes .
i'll follow this good man , and go with you ; and , having sworn truth , ever will be true .
then lead the way , good father ; and heavens so shine that they may fairly note this act of mine .
now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
good master fabian , grant me another request .
anything .
do not desire to see this letter .
belong you to the lady olivia , friends ?
ay , sir , we are some of her trappings .
i know thee well .
how dost thou , my good fellow ?
truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
the better for thy friends .
no , sir , the worse .
how can that be ?
i'll ride home tomorrow , sir toby .
then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
why , would that have mended my hair ?
past question , for thou seest it will not curl by nature .
but it becomes me well enough , does ' t not ?
excellent .
it hangs like flax on a distaff .
faith , i'll home tomorrow , sir toby .
the count himself here hard by woos her .
i have heard her swear ' t .
tut , there's life in ' t , man .
marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly i am an ass .
so that by my foes , sir i profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , i am abused .
so that , conclusions to be as kisses , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives , why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes .
why , this is excellent .
by my troth , sir , no , though it please you to be one of my friends .
thou shalt not be the worse for me : there's gold .
but that it would be double-dealing , sir , i would you could make it another .
o , you give me ill counsel .
well , i will be so much a sinner , to be a double-dealer .
there's another .
primo , secundo , tertio is a good play , and the old saying is , the third pays for all .
the triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of saint bennet , sir , may put you in mind , one , two , three .
you can fool no more money out of me at this throw .
if you will let your lady know i am here to speak with her , and bring her along with you , it may awake my bounty further .
marry , sir , lullaby to your bounty till i come again .
i go , sir , but i would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness .
but , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , i will awake it anon .
here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
that face of his i do remember well .
yet , when i saw it last , it was besmeared as black as vulcan in the smoke of war .
a baubling vessel was he captain of , for shallow draught and bulk unprizable , with which such scathful grapple did he make with the most noble bottom of our fleet , that very envy and the tongue of loss cried fame and honor on him . , what's the matter ?
orsino , this is that antonio that took the and this is he that did the when your young nephew titus lost his leg .
he did me kindness , sir , drew on my side , but in conclusion put strange speech upon me .
i know not what ' twas but distraction .
notable pirate !
orsino , noble sir , be pleased that i shake off these names you give me .
antonio never yet was thief or pirate , though , i confess , on base and ground enough , orsino's enemy .
that most ingrateful boy there by your side from the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth did i redeem .
a wreck past hope he was .
his life i gave him and did thereto add my love , without retention or restraint , all his in dedication .
how can this be ?
here comes the countess .
now heaven walks on earth .
what would my lord , but that he may not have , wherein olivia may seem serviceable ?
cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
madam ?
gracious olivia , what do you say , cesario ? , good my lord , my lord would speak .
my duty hushes me .
still so cruel ?
still so constant , lord .
what , to perverseness ?
you , uncivil lady , to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars my soul the faithfull'st off'rings have breathed out that e'er devotion tendered , what shall i do ?
even what it please my lord that shall become him .
come , boy , with me .
and i , most jocund , apt , and willingly , to do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
where goes cesario ?
ay me , detested !
who does beguile you ?
who does do you wrong ?
hast thou forgot thyself ?
is it so long ? , call forth the holy father .
come , away !
whither , my lord ? , cesario , husband , stay .
husband ?
ay , husband .
can he that deny ?
her husband , sirrah ?
no , my lord , not i . alas , it is the baseness of thy fear that makes thee strangle thy propriety .
fear not , cesario .
be that thou know'st thou art , and then thou art as great as that thou fear'st .
o , welcome , father !
father , i charge thee , by thy reverence , here to unfold ( though lately we intended to keep in darkness what occasion now reveals before ' tis ripe ) what thou dost know hath newly passed between this youth and me .
my lord , i do protest , o , do not swear !
hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
for the love of god , a surgeon !
send one presently to sir toby .
what's the matter ?
he has broke my head across and has given sir toby a bloody coxcomb too .
for the love of god , your help !
i had rather than forty pound i were at home .
who has done this , sir andrew ?
the count's gentleman , one cesario .
we took him for a coward , but he's the very devil incardinate .
my gentleman , cesario ?
od's lifelings , here he is ! , you broke my head for nothing , and that that i did , i was set on to do ' t by sir toby .
why do you speak to me ?
i never hurt you .
if a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me .
i think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb .
here comes sir toby halting .
you shall hear more .
but if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
how now , gentleman ?
how is ' t with you ?
that's all one : has hurt me , and there's the end on ' t .
FOOL oh , he's drunk , sir toby , an hour agone .
his eyes were set at eight i ' the morning .
then he's a rogue , and a passy-measures pavin .
i hate a drunken rogue .
away with him !
who hath made this havoc with them ?
i'll help you , sir toby , because we'll be dressed together .
will you help ? , an ass-head , and a coxcomb , and a knave , a thin-faced knave , a gull !
get him to bed , and let his hurt be looked to .
pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows we made each other but so late ago .
one face , one voice , one habit , and two persons !
antonio , o my dear antonio !
how have the hours racked and tortured me since i have lost thee !
sebastian are you ?
fear'st thou that , antonio ?
how have you made division of yourself ?
an apple , cleft in two , is not more twin than these two creatures .
which is sebastian ?
most wonderful !
sebastian was my father ; such a sebastian was my brother too , so went he suited to his watery tomb .
a spirit i am indeed , but am in that dimension grossly clad which from the womb i did participate .
"were you a woman , as the rest goes even , i should my tears let fall upon your cheek and say "" thrice-welcome , drowned viola ! "" my father had a mole upon his brow ."
and so had mine .
and died that day when viola from her birth had numbered thirteen years .
i'll stay a month longer .
i am a fellow o ' th ' strangest mind i ' th ' world .
i delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .
art thou good at these kickshawses , knight ?
wherefore are these things hid ?
wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ' em ?
are they like to take dust , like mistress mall's picture ?
why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto ?
i would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace .
what dost thou mean ?
is it a world to hide virtues in ?
i did think , by the excellent constitution of thy leg , it was formed under the star of a galliard .
ay , ' tis strong , and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock .
what shall we do else ?
were we not born under taurus ?
oh , that record is lively in my soul !
he finished indeed his mortal act that day that made my sister thirteen years .
give me thy hand , and let me see thee in thy woman's weeds .
the captain that did bring me first on shore hath my maid's garments .
he , upon some action , is now in durance at malvolio's suit , a gentleman and follower of my lady's .
he shall enlarge him .
a most extracting frenzy of mine own from my remembrance clearly banished his .
truly , madam , he holds beelzebub at the staves ' end as well as a man in his case may do .
has here writ a letter to you .
i should have given ' t you today morning , but as a madman's epistles are no gospels , so it skills not much when they are delivered .
open ' t , and read it .
look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman .
how now ?
art thou mad ?
no , madam , i do but read madness .
an your ladyship will have it as it ought to be , you must allow prithee , read i ' thy right wits .
so i do , madonna .
but to read his right wits is to read thus .
therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
by the lord , madam , you wrong me , and the world shall know it .
though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me , yet have i the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship .
think of me as you please .
i leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
"the madly used malvolio . "" did he write this ?"
ay , madam .
this savors not much of distraction .
see him delivered , fabian ; bring him hither .
madam , i am most apt to embrace your offer .
is this the madman ?
ay , my lord , this same .
how now , malvolio !
madam , you have done me wrong , notorious wrong .
have i , malvolio ?
no .
tell me why .
alas , malvolio , this is not my writing , though , i confess , much like the character .
but out of question , ' tis maria's hand .
and now i do bethink me , it was she first told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , and in such forms which here were presupposed upon thee in the letter .
prithee , be content .
"why , "" some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them . "" i was one , sir , in this interlude , one sir topas , sir , but that's all one ."
he hath been most notoriously abused .
pursue him and entreat him to a peace .
he hath not told us of the captain yet .
cesario , come , for so you shall be , while you are a man .
taurus !
that's sides and heart .
no , sir , it is legs and thighs .
let me see the caper .
he hath known you but three days , and already you are no stranger .
no , believe me .
i thank you .
here comes the count .
who saw cesario , ho ?
be clamorous , and leap all civil bounds , rather than make unprofited return .
i think not so , my lord .
dear lad , believe it .
for they shall yet belie thy happy years that say thou art a man .
i know thy constellation is right apt for this affair .
i'll do my best to woo your lady , whoe'er i woo , myself would be his wife .
give me excess of it that , surfeiting , the appetite may sicken , and so die .
oh , it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound , that breathes upon a bank of violets , stealing and giving odor .
tis not so sweet now as it was before .
so full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical .
will you go hunt , my lord ?
what , curio ?
my lady will hang thee for thy absence .
let her hang me .
make that good .
he shall see none to fear .
a good lenten answer .
"i can tell thee where that saying was born , of "" i fear no colors . "" where , good mistress mary ?"
in the wars .
well , god give them wisdom that have it .
yet you will be hanged for being so long absent .
you are resolute , then ?
well , go thy way .
if sir toby would leave drinking , thou wert as witty a piece of eve's flesh as any in illyria .
peace , you rogue , no more o ' that .
here comes my lady .
take the fool away .
do you not hear , fellows ?
take away the lady .
go to , you're a dry fool .
i'll no more of you .
besides , you grow dishonest .
if he can not , let the botcher mend him .
anything that's mended is but patched .
virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin , and sin that amends is but patched with virtue .
if that this simple syllogism will serve , so .
if it will not , what remedy ?
sir , i bade them take away you .
good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
can you do it ?
dexterously , good madonna .
i must catechise you for it , madonna .
good my mouse of virtue , answer me .
well , sir , for want of other idleness , i'll bide your proof .
good madonna , why mournest thou ?
good fool , for my brother's death .
i think his soul is in hell , madonna .
i know his soul is in heaven , fool .
the more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven .
take away the fool , gentlemen .
what think you of this fool , malvolio ?
doth he not mend ?
yes , and shall do till the pangs of death shake him .
infirmity , that decays the wise , doth ever make the better fool .
god send you , sir , a speedy infirmity , for the better increasing your folly !
sir toby will be sworn that i am no fox , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool .
how say you to that , malvolio ?
i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal .
i saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
i protest i take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies .
oh , you are sick of self-love , malvolio , and taste with a distempered appetite .
now mercury endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools !
madam , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you .
from the count orsino , is it ?
i know not , madam .
tis a fair young man , and well attended .
who of my people hold him in delay ?
sir toby , madam , your kinsman .
he speaks nothing but madman .
if it be a suit from the count , i am sick , or not at home .
what is he at the gate , cousin ?
a gentleman .
a gentleman ?
what gentleman ?
good sir toby !
lechery !
i defy lechery .
there's one at the gate .
ay , marry , what is he ?
let him be the devil , an he will , i care not .
give me faith , say i .
what's a drunken man like , fool ?
like a drowned man , a fool and a madman .
one draught above heat makes him a fool , the second mads him , and a third drowns him .
go look after him .
madam , yond young fellow swears he will speak with you .
i told him you were sick .
he takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you .
i told him you were asleep .
he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you .
what is to be said to him , lady ?
he's fortified against any denial .
tell him he shall not speak with me .
what manner of man ?
of very ill manner .
he'll speak with you , will you or no .
of what personage and years is he ?
not yet old enough for a man , nor young enough for a boy , as a squash is before ' tis a peascod , or a codling when ' tis almost an apple .
tis with him in standing water , between boy and man .
he is very well-favored , and he speaks very shrewishly .
one would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him .
let him approach .
call in my gentlewoman .
gentlewoman , my lady calls .
give me my veil .
come , throw it o'er my face .
the honorable lady of the house , which is she ?
speak to me .
i shall answer for her .
your will ?
most radiant , exquisite and unmatchable beauty , i pray you , tell me if this be the lady of the house , for i never saw her .
i would be loath to cast away my speech , for besides that it is excellently well penned , i have taken great pains to con it .
good beauties , let me sustain no scorn .
i am very comptible , even to the least sinister usage .
whence came you , sir ?
i can say little more than i have studied , and that question's out of my part .
good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that i may proceed in my speech .
are you a comedian ?
no , my profound heart .
and yet , by the very fangs of malice i swear , i am not that i play .
are you the lady of the house ?
if i do not usurp myself , i am .
most certain , if you are she , you do usurp yourself , for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve .
but this is from my commission .
i will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message .
come to what is important in ' t .
i forgive you the praise .
alas , i took great pains to study it , and ' tis poetical .
it is the more like to be feigned .
i pray you , keep it in .
if you be not mad , be gone .
will you hoist sail , sir ?
here lies your way .
tell me your mind .
speak your office .
it alone concerns your ear .
i bring no overture of war , no taxation of homage .
my words are as full of peace as matter .
yet you began rudely .
what are you ?
what would you ?
how now !
what news from her ?
away before me to sweet beds of flowers .
what i am and what i would are as secret as maidenhead .
give us the place alone .
most sweet lady , a comfortable doctrine , and much may be said of it .
where lies your text ?
in orsino's bosom .
in his bosom ?
in what chapter of his bosom ?
to answer by the method , in the first of his heart .
oh , i have read it .
it is heresy .
have you no more to say ?
good madam , let me see your face .
have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?
you are now out of your text .
but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture .
look you , sir , such a one i was this present .
is ' t not well done ?
twill endure wind and weather .
o , sir , i will not be so hard-hearted .
i will give out divers schedules of my beauty .
but , if you were the devil , you are fair .
my lord and master loves you .
how does he love me ?
your lord does know my mind .
i can not love him .
yet i suppose him virtuous , know him noble , of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth .
in voices well divulged , free , learned , and valiant ; and in dimension and the shape of nature a gracious person .
but yet i can not love him ; he might have took his answer long ago .
why , what would you ?
make me a willow cabin at your gate and call upon my soul within the house .
write loyal cantons of contemned love and sing them loud even in the dead of night .
you might do much .
above my fortunes , yet my state is well .
i am a gentleman .
get you to your lord .
i can not love him .
let him send no more , unless perchance you come to me again to tell me how he takes it .
fare you well .
i thank you for your pains .
spend this for me .
i am no fee'd post , lady .
keep your purse .
my master , not myself , lacks recompense .
farewell , fair cruelty .
"what is your parentage ? "" "" above my fortunes , yet my state is well ."
not too fast !
soft , soft !
unless the master were the man .
how now ?
even so quickly may one catch the plague ?
well , let it be . , what ho , malvolio !
here , madam , at your service .
run after that same peevish messenger , the county's man .
he left this ring behind him , would i or not .
madam , i will .
i do i know not what and fear to find mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .
fate , show thy force .
ourselves we do not owe .
what is decreed must be , and be this so .
by your patience , no .
let me yet know of you whither you are bound .
no , sooth , sir .
my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy .
but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in .
he left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour .
if the heavens had been pleased , would we had so ended !
but you , sir , altered that , for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned .
alas the day !
a lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful .
she is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
o good antonio , forgive me your trouble .
if you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
fare you well at once .
i am bound to the count orsino's court .
farewell .
the gentleness of all the gods go with thee !
i have many enemies in orsino's court , else would i very shortly see thee there .
but , come what may , i do adore thee so that danger shall seem sport , and i will go .
were not you even now with the countess olivia ?
even now , sir .
on a moderate pace i have since arrived but hither .
she returns this ring to you , sir .
you might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .
receive it so .
she took the ring of me .
i'll none of it .
come , sir , you peevishly threw it to her , and her will is it should be so returned .
i left no ring with her .
what means this lady ?
fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her !
she made good view of me , indeed so much that sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , for she did speak in starts distractedly .
she loves me , sure !
the cunning of her passion invites me in this churlish messenger .
i am the man .
if it be so , as ' tis , poor lady , she were better love a dream .
how will this fadge ?
what will become of this ?
o time , thou must untangle this , not i .
it is too hard a knot for me to untie !
approach , sir andrew .
not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes , and nay , my troth , i know not .
but i know to be up late is to be up late .
a false conclusion .
i hate it as an unfilled can .
thou'rt a scholar .
let us therefore eat and drink .
marian , i say !
a stoup of wine !
here comes the fool , i ' faith .
how now , my hearts !
"did you never see the picture of "" we three "" ?"
welcome , ass .
now let's have a catch .
what country , friends , is this ?
this is illyria , lady .
and what should i do in illyria ?
my brother he is in elysium .
perchance he is not drown'd . , what think you , sailors ?
it is perchance that you yourself were saved .
o , my poor brother !
and so perchance may he be .
true , madam .
know'st thou this country ?
ay , madam , well , for i was bred and born not three hours ' travel from this very place .
by my troth , the fool has an excellent breast .
my lady has a white hand , and the myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses .
if one knight give a , would you have a love song or a song of good life ?
a love song , a love song .
ay , ay .
i care not for good life .
excellent good , i ' faith .
good , good .
a mellifluous voice , as i am true knight .
a contagious breath .
very sweet and contagious , i ' faith .
shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver ?
shall we do that ?
an you love me , let's do ' t .
most certain .
"let our catch be "" thou knave . "" "" hold thy peace , thou knave , "" knight ?"
i shall be constrained in ' t to call thee knave , knight .
"it begins "" hold thy peace . "" i shall never begin if i hold my peace ."
good , i ' faith .
come , begin .
what a caterwauling do you keep here !
if my lady have not called up her steward malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors , never trust me .
for the love o ' god , peace !
my masters , are you mad ?
or what are you ?
have you no wit , manners , nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night ?
is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you ?
we did keep time , sir , in our catches .
sneck up !
sir toby , i must be round with you .
my lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbors you as her kinsman , she's nothing allied to your disorders .
if you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors , you are welcome to the house .
if not , an it would please you to take leave of her , she is very willing to bid you farewell .
nay , good sir toby .
out o ' tune , sir .
you lie .
yes , by saint anne , and ginger shall be hot i ' the mouth too .
thou'rt i ' the right .
go shake your ears !
twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry , to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him .
do ' t , knight .
i'll write thee a challenge .
or i'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
sweet sir toby , be patient for tonight .
since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet .
for monsieur malvolio , let me alone with him .
i know i can do it .
o , if i thought that , i'd beat him like a dog !
i have no exquisite reason for ' t , but i have reason good enough .
and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work .
what wilt thou do ?
i can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
excellent !
i have ' t in my nose too .
he shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she's in love with him .
my purpose is , indeed , a horse of that color .
and your horse now would make him an ass .
ass , i doubt not .
oh , ' twill be admirable !
sport royal , i warrant you .
i know my physic will work with him .
i will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter .
observe his construction of it .
for this night , to bed , and dream on the event .
farewell .
good night , penthesilea .
before me , she's a good wench .
she's a beagle , true-bred , and one that adores me .
what o ' that ?
i was adored once too .
let's to bed , knight .
thou hadst need send for more money .
"if thou hast her not i ' the end , call me "" cut . "" if i do not , never trust me , take it how you will ."
tis too late to go to bed now .
give me some music .
he is not here , so please your lordship , that should sing it .
who was it ?
he is about the house .
thou dost speak masterly .
my life upon ' t , young though thou art , thine eye hath stay'd upon some favor that it loves .
hath it not , boy ?
a little , by your favor .
what kind of woman is't ?
of your complexion .
she is not worth thee , then .
what years , i ' faith ?
about your years , my lord .
too old by heaven .
let still the woman take an elder than herself .
i think it well , my lord .
then let thy love be younger than thyself , or thy affection can not hold the bent .
for women are as roses , whose fair flower being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
and so they are .
alas , that they are so , to die even when they to perfection grow !
who governs here ?
a noble duke , in nature as in name .
what is his name ?
orsino .
orsino .
i have heard my father name him .
he was a bachelor then .
for but a month ago i went from hence , and then ' twas fresh in murmur , as , you know , what great ones do the less will prattle of , that he did seek the love of fair olivia .
what's she ?
oh , that i served that lady and might not be delivered to the world , till i had made mine own occasion mellow , what my estate is .
are you ready , sir ?
no pains , sir .
i take pleasure in singing , sir .
i'll pay thy pleasure then .
give me now leave to leave thee .
farewell .
let all the rest give place .
once more , cesario , get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty .
tell her my love , more noble than the world , prizes not quantity of dirty lands ; the parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her , tell her , i hold as giddily as fortune ; but ' tis that miracle and queen of gems that nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
but if she can not love you , sir ?
i can not be so answer'd .
sooth , but you must .
say that some lady , as perhaps there is , hath for your love a great a pang of heart as you have for olivia .
must she not then be answered ?
there is no woman's sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart .
no woman's heart so big , to hold so much .
they lack retention .
alas , their love may be called appetite , no motion of the liver , but the palate , that suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; but mine is all as hungry as the sea , and can digest as much .
make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that i owe olivia .
ay , but i know , what dost thou know ?
too well what love women to men may owe .
in faith , they are as true of heart as we .
my father had a daughter loved a man as it might be , perhaps , were i a woman , i should your lordship .
and what's her history ?
a blank , my lord .
was not this love indeed ?
but died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
i am all the daughters of my father's house , and all the brothers too , and yet i know not .
sir , shall i to this lady ?
come thy ways , signior fabian .
nay , i'll come .
if i lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame ?
i would exult , man .
you know , he brought me out o ' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here .
to anger him , we'll have the bear again , and we will fool him black and blue .
shall we not , sir andrew ?
an we do not , it is pity of our lives .
here comes the little villain .
how now , my metal of india ?
get you all three into the boxtree .
malvolio's coming down this walk .
he has been yonder i ' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour .
observe him , for the love of mockery , for i know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him .
