now , you lie there on the path .
she said if she were interested in someone , it would be someone who looked like me .
besides , she treats me more respectfully than the other servants .
what's the obvious conclusion from that ?
just think , i could be count malvolio !
lady strachy married her wardrobe manager .
i'd send seven of my servants to go get him .
while i waited , i'd frown impatiently , and perhaps wind my watch , or play with my , with some expensive piece of jewelry i happen to be wearing .
"i can't let my lips say his name ; "" no man must know . """
"no man must know . "" what comes after that ?"
"no man must know . "" what if this someone were you , malvolio ?"
but silence , like a knife , cuts open my heart with strokes that draw no blood .
"rules my life . "" hmm , let me see , let me see , let me see ."
"i may command the one i love . "" well , she commands me ."
why , anyone can see what this means .
there's no ambiguity here .
if only i could somehow relate them to me !
you seem to be a good person , captain , and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside , i believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners .
please , and i'll pay you plenty for this , help me conceal my identity , and find me the right disguise so i can look the way i want .
i want to be this duke's servant .
you'll introduce me to him as a eunuch .
you won't be wasting your time , because i really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music , so he'll be happy to have me in his service .
you can be a eunuch , but i'll be mute .
i swear on my life i won't tell your secret .
thank you .
show me the way .
"m "" , malvolio ."
"m "" , why , that's the first letter in my name ."
but if i shake it up a little it'll work , because every one of those letters is in my name .
but wait , there's some prose after her poem .
if this letter falls into your hands , think carefully about what it says .
by my birth i rank above you , but don't be afraid of my greatness .
some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them .
your fate awaits you .
accept it in body and spirit .
to get used to the life you'll most likely be leading soon , get rid of your low-class trappings .
go ahead .
goodbye .
"signed , she who would be your servant , the fortunate unhappy . "" this is as clear as sunlight in an open field ."
i'll do it .
i'll be vain and proud , i'll read up on politics , i'll insult sir toby , i'll get rid of my lower-class friends , and i'll be the perfect man for her .
i know i'm not fooling myself , or letting myself get carried away by my imagination , because every clue points to the fact that lady olivia loves me .
she did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently , and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs .
oh , i thank my lucky stars , i'm so happy .
for her i'll be strange and condescending , and i'll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away .
thank god and my horoscope !
here's a postscript ! .
you must have figured out who i am .
if you love me , let me know by smiling at me .
you're so attractive when you smile .
"please smile whenever you're near me , my dearest darling . """
dear god , thank you !
i'll do everything she wants me to do .
i wouldn't have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds , to be paid by the shah of persia .
i could marry that maria for thinking this up .
so could i .
and i wouldn't ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one .
neither would i .
here she comes , the brilliant fool-catcher .
may i kiss your feet ?
and i too ?
shall i be your slave ?
me too .
you've made him so delusional he'll go crazy when he learns the truth .
did it really work ?
like medicine for a sick man .
if you want to watch , follow me .
i'd follow you to the gates of hell , you sneaky little devil !
i'll come too .
god bless you , my friend , and your music too .
do you make your living by playing that drum ?
no , sir , i live by the church .
oh , you're a clergyman ?
"you could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him , or that the church is supported by your drum because it "" stands by "" your drum ."
you're right , sir .
what a wonderful time to be alive !
that's true .
that's why i wish my sister didn't have a name , sir .
why , man ?
well , her name's a word , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore .
why do you say that ?
honestly , sir , i'd need to use words to explain why , and since words are so unreliable and false , i'd rather avoid using them in a serious discussion .
i bet you're a happy fellow who doesn't care about anything .
you're wrong , sir , i do care about something .
but i'll admit i don't care for you .
if that means i don't care about anything , you should disappear right now , since you're nothing .
aren't you lady olivia's fool ?
no , sir .
i saw you at count orsino's recently .
i'm everywhere .
i think i saw you there , you wise man .
wait , here's a coin for you .
next time god sends out a shipment of hair , i hope he gives you a beard !
oh , i know .
yes , if you kept them together and invested them .
my lady olivia's inside , sir .
i'll tell them where you come from , though i don't know who you are or what you want .
"i'd say i was "" out of my element , "" but that phrase is overused , so i'll say i'm "" out of my air . """
this guy's wise enough to play the fool , and only clever people can do that .
and he doesn't let go of his target when a distraction appears .
hello , sir .
hello to you too , sir .
i'm headed for your niece , sir .
she's the reason i'm here .
taste your legs , sir .
please go inside .
i mean please go into the house , sir .
i will .
but now we don't have to !
oh , beautiful and accomplished lady , may the heavens rain odors upon you !
my message is not for anyone else to hear , my lady .
it's only for your willing and receptive ear .
close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message .
give me your hand , sir .
i give you my obedience and my humble service , madam .
what's your name ?
cesario is my name , your servant's name , fair princess .
my servant !
the world's gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments .
as for him , i never think about him .
as for his thoughts , i wish he'd think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time .
madam , i've come here to try to make you like him .
oh , please , i'm begging you , don't mention him again .
my dear lady , please let me say something , i'm begging you .
after you cast your magic spell on me last time , i sent you a ring .
what else could you possibly think of me ?
what's wrong with my niece ?
for god's sake , sir toby , you've got to come home earlier at night .
my lady olivia , your niece , disapproves of your late-night partying .
well , she can get used to it .
keep myself ?
they're good enough to drink in , and so are these boots .
if they aren't , they can go hang themselves by their own laces !
who , sir andrew aguecheek ?
yes , that's the one .
he's as
haven't you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger ?
for someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough .
so let me hear what you have to say .
i feel sorry for you .
that's a step in the direction of love .
no , not at all .
it's much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one .
i wish you all the best .
you do stay , please , tell me what you think of me .
i think you're denying what you really are .
if that's true , i think the same thing about you .
i wish you were what i wanted you to be !
would it be better if i were that , instead of what i am ?
i wish i were something better , because right now i'm a big fool .
so goodbye , my lady .
no , i won't stay a second longer .
why are you leaving , my angry friend ?
yes , you have to tell us why , sir andrew .
well , because i saw your niece olivia treat the count's messenger better than she's ever treated me .
i saw it in the orchard .
did she see you there the whole time , old boy ?
tell me that .
yes , she saw me quite clearly .
well , that proves she's in love with you .
are you trying to make fun of me ?
no , i'll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument .
and you can't deny evidence and argument , they've been around since noah's ark .
she flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you , fire up your passions , and make you angry and jealous .
you should have run up to her , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot , and rendered the young man speechless .
that's what she was expecting , and you let her down .
i'll have to do something courageous then , because i hate intrigue .
i'd rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots .
well then , improve your situation with a show of courage .
challenge the count's young servant to a fight .
hurt him in eleven different places .
my niece olivia will notice , and let me tell you , no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage .
it's really the only way , sir andrew .
will either of you give him the message that i'm challenging him to a duel ?
go ahead and write it down .
be pointed and brief .
it doesn't need to be witty as long as it's eloquent and imaginative .
go on .
this precious little guy is putty in your hands , sir toby .
his letter's going to be hilarious .
but you're not going to deliver it , are you ?
never trust me again if i don't .
and by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it .
i don't think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight .
here comes my little bird .
listen , if you want a good laugh , and i mean a side-splitting one , then follow me .
he's wearing yellow stockings .
with crisscrossed laces ?
oh , he looks like a pathetic sunday school teacher .
he smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the east indies .
you've never seen anything like it .
i can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him .
i know that my lady's going to end up hitting him .
and when she does , he'll imagine she's flirting with him .
come on , take us to him .
i couldn't stay behind after you left .
my friend antonio , all i can say is thank you .
anyway , what should we do ?
should we go see the sights in the town ?
you probably killed a lot of his men ?
the whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them , which most of our city did , for the sake of friendly trade relations .
i was the only one who refused to give back what i stole .
then don't make yourself too conspicuous .
you're right .
hang on a minute , here's some money for you .
maybe you'll see some little trinket you want to buy .
i'll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour .
we'll meet at the elephant .
i remember .
i've sent for him .
he says he'll come .
it's easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them .
oh , i'm talking too loud . , where's malvolio ?
he's very serious , which is right for someone in mourning like me .
where is malvolio ?
he's coming , madam ; but he's acting very strangely .
he must be possessed by the devil .
why , what's the matter with him ?
is he talking nonsense ?
no , he just smiles .
you should have a guard nearby if he comes in here , because he's clearly disturbed .
ask him in here .
i'm as crazy as he is , if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent .
what's going on , malvolio ?
hello , sweet lady .
why , he has an income of three thousand ducats a year .
he's a fool and a spendthrift .
you shouldn't talk about him like that !
anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage .
who said that ?
the same people who say he gets drunk with you every night .
we only drink toasts to my niece .
i'll drink to her as long as there's a hole in my throat and booze in illyria .
anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum .
sir toby belch !
how are you , sir toby belch ?
sweet sir andrew !
you're smiling ?
i sent for you about a sad occasion .
sad , my lady !
i could be sad if i wanted to be .
these crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit , but who cares ?
"as the sonnet says , "" if you please one special person , you please everyone who matters . "" why , what's going on ?"
what's the matter with you ?
my legs may be yellow , but i don't feel blue .
it was addressed to him , and orders must be obeyed .
i think we know whose fancy handwriting that was .
don't you think you should go to bed , malvolio ?
to bed !
how are you feeling , malvolio ?
you're asking me !
noble people don't answer to peasants !
why are you acting so brazen toward my lady ?
"don't be afraid of greatness . "" that was well written ."
what do you mean by that , malvolio ?
"some are born great , """
what ?
"some achieve greatness , "" what are you saying ?"
"and some have greatness thrust upon them . "" heaven help you !"
"remember who liked your yellow stockings , "" your yellow stockings ?"
"and wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs . "" crisscrossed ?"
go ahead .
madam , count orsino's young messenger has returned .
i'll go to him .
maria , take care of this poor fellow here .
where's my cousin toby ?
have some of my servants take care of malvolio .
i'd give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him .
oh ho !
look at me now !
this is just what the letter said .
"get rid of your low-class trapping , "" she said ."
i've got her now , but i've got god to thank for it !
"and when she left just now , she said "" take care of this poor fellow here . "" fellow ! "" not "" malvolio , "" not anything referring to my low station in life , but "" fellow . "" everything's going perfectly ."
nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes .
well , god is responsible for that , not me , and he deserves thanks .
i don't care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him , i still want to speak to him .
here he is , here he is .
how are you , sir ?
go away .
let me enjoy my privacy .
go away .
ah-ha !
does she ?
do you even know what you're talking about ?
sure thing , we'll do it tomorrow morning .
my lady would never want to lose him .
what are you saying , mistress ?
oh , lord !
gentleness is the only way to go , gently , gently .
the devil inside him is rough , but we can't treat it roughly .
sir !
yes , dear little chick , come along with me . , shut up , man !
you're serious enough to know not to play games with satan .
damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil !
get him to say his prayers , sir toby , get him to pray .
my prayers , you hussy ?
go hang yourselves , all of you !
you're all lazy and shallow .
i'm not like you .
you'll know more about it later .
is it possible ?
if this were a play , i'd complain it was unrealistic .
he's really taken this prank to heart .
no , follow him now , before he divulges the prank and ruins everything .
wow , we're really going to drive him crazy .
the house will be so much quieter .
come on , let's put him in a dark room and tie him up .
my niece already thinks he's insane .
here's more insanity for us .
is it that aggressive ?
yes , it is , i think .
just read it .
give it to me .
that's a good thing to put in , it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law .
nice and short and full of good sense , or should i say nonsense ?
good .
you still haven't said anything incriminating .
good .
"andrew aguecheek """
if this letter doesn't make him fight , i don't know what will .
i'll give it to him .
you might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now .
he's conducting some business with my lady , and sooner or later he'll leave .
go , sir andrew .
look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff's deputy .
now go !
don't worry about me not swearing enough .
the fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece olivia confirms this .
so this letter , which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant , isn't going to scare him at all .
he'll just think an idiot wrote it .
but i'll deliver sir andrew's challenge by word of mouth , describing sir andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that sir andrew is furious , impetuous , and a skilled fighter ( he'll believe me because he's young ) .
this will make them both so afraid that they'll kill each other just by looking at each other .
here comes the messenger with your niece .
leave them alone until he sets off home , and then follow him .
meanwhile , i'll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge .
my lord acts just as crazy with love as you do .
here , take this piece of jewelry .
there's a picture of me inside .
don't refuse it .
it won't annoy you like me , because it doesn't have a voice .
and i beg you , please come here again tomorrow .
what could you possibly ask of me that i wouldn't give you , as long as it didn't damage my honor and self-respect ?
nothing , except your true love for my lord .
how could i honorably give him what i've already given you ?
i'll give it back to you .
just come again tomorrow .
good-bye .
a devil like you could lead me to hell .
hello , sir .
hello to you .
you'd better think up a way to defend yourself .
i don't know what you've done to upset him , but someone has challenged you to a duel .
draw your sword and get on your toes , because your assailant is quick , skillful , and deadly .
there must be some mistake , sir .
i'm sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me .
i can't remember anything i've ever done to offend anyone .
you're wrong about that , i assure you .
but who is this person , sir ?
he's a knight .
he's killed three people , and he's so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die .
"fight to the death "" is his motto ."
hello , sir .
chat her up , sir andrew .
what ?
my dear miss chat-her-up , i look forward to getting to know you better .
my name is mary , sir .
i was telling you to go after her , woo her , confront her .
is that really what you meant ?
if you let her go this easily , sir andrew , you don't deserve to ever use your sword again .
if you leave like this , my dear , i won't ever use my sword again .
do you think you've got a couple of fools on your hands here ?
i'm not holding your hand , sir .
i'll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort .
i'm not a fighter .
i've heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose , just to see how brave they are .
this man is probably like that .
no , sir .
he's furious because you insulted him , and he has a right to satisfaction .
so go out there and give him what he wants .
you can't go back into the house unless you want to fight with me , and if you're willing to do that , you might as well just go and fight with him .
this is as rude as it is strange .
please , do me this one favor : find out what i've done to offend this knight .
it must be something i did accidentally .
i will do so .
mr . fabian , stay with this gentleman until i come back .
excuse me , sir , do you know anything about this ?
what kind of man is he ?
he really is the most skillful , bloodthirsty , and dangerous opponent you can find in illyria .
do you want to go see him ?
i'll try to calm him down for you if i can .
i'd be very grateful to you if you did .
wow , he's a real devil .
i've never seen such a monster .
i had a round with him , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can't even duck out of the way .
and when he strikes back at you , he'll hit you as sure as you're standing there .
they say he used to fence for the shah of persia .
that's it !
i won't mess with him .
yes , but now there's no way to calm him down .
fabian can hardly control him over there .
darn it , if i'd guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman , i never would have challenged him .
i'll give him my gray horse capilet if he forgets the whole thing .
i'll give it a try .
stay right here and try to look good .
this may end without anyone getting killed .
he's just as terrified of sir andrew .
he's pale and hyperventilating , as if a bear were chasing him .
come on , sir andrew , there's nothing you can do about it .
the gentleman insists on fighting a round with you , for the sake of his honor .
the rules of dueling say he has to .
but as a gentleman and a soldier he's promised me he won't hurt you .
come on , get ready .
i hope to god he keeps his promise !
i swear to you , i don't want to be doing this .
put your sword away .
if this young gentleman has offended you , i'll take the blame for it .
if you've offended him , i'll fight you .
you , sir ?
who are you ?
in fact , i'd do even more to him than what you've heard him promise to do .
if you're someone who gets into fights , i'll fight with you .
oh , sir toby , stop !
the police are here .
i certainly will , sir .
and as for what i promised to you , i'm as good as my word .
you can ride him easily , and he responds well when you pull the reins .
this is the man .
do your job .
antonio , you're under arrest on the orders of count orsino .
you must be mistaking me for someone else , sir .
no , sir , not at all .
i recognize your face perfectly , even without a sailor's cap on your head . , take him away .
he knows i recognize him .
i have to obey .
don't worry about me .
come on , sir , let's go .
what money , sir ?
take this .
it's half of all my money .
are you really going to pretend you don't know me now ?
i hate an ungrateful man more than i hate lying , vanity , babbling , drunkenness , or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to . , oh , my god !
come on , sir , please .
let's go .
let's go !
but oh , what a deceiver he turned out to be !
only really cruel people can be called deformed .
virtue is beauty , but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil .
the man's going crazy .
take him away .
take me .
i don't believe it .
yet i wish i could .
oh , please be true , please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you , my dear brother !
come here , sir andrew .
you too , fabian .
we've got some words of wisdom to mull over .
he called me sebastian .
with the same accessories .
oh , if it turns out to be true that he survived , then that storm was kind , and the ocean was full of love !
he's a very dishonest , puny boy , and more cowardly than a rabbit .
he abandoned his friend here in an emergency , and even pretended he didn't know him .
as for his cowardliness , ask fabian .
he's a coward , a total coward .
by god , i'll go after him again and beat him up .
i swear i will , come on , let's go see what happens .
i'll bet anything you like that nothing will happen , once again .
leave me alone .
good for you , holding out on me like this !
no , i don't know you , and my lady didn't send me to get you , and i'm not supposed to tell you to come speak with her , and your name is not master cesario , and this is not my nose , either .
nothing is what it is .
oh please , go somewhere else to blab your nonsense .
you don't know me .
blab my nonsense ?
he must've heard that phrase describing some great man and now he's using it on a jester .
blab my nonsense !
what an idiotic place this world is .
now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly i should blab to my lady .
should i blab to her that you're coming ?
please , fool , go away .
here's money for you .
well , well .
wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation , if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years .
stop right now or i'll throw your dagger over the roof .
no , leave him alone .
i'll get back at him another way .
i'll sue him for assault and battery , if there's any justice in illyria .
it doesn't matter that i hit him first .
no , sir , i won't let you go .
come on , put your sword away , my little soldier .
you're awfully eager to fight .
come on .
i'll get free of you .
what are you going to do now ?
if you insist on trying my patience any further , then take out your sword right now .
what ?
because then i'd have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood .
stop , sir toby !
i order you to stop !
madam !
are you always going to be like this ?
get out of my sight ! , dear cesario , please don't be offended . , get out of here , you barbarian !
you have to come with me .
please don't say no .
damn that toby !
he made my heart leap for you .
why , sweetheart ?
your hand is well , i hope so .
i'm not such an idiot that i can't keep my hands dry .
but i don't get it , what's the joke ?
just a bit of my dry humor , sir .
are you always so funny ?
but oops , when i let go of your hand , i let go of the biggest joke of all .
sir , you need a drink .
when has anyone ever put you down like that .
never .
sometimes i think i'm no smarter than average .
if this is a dream , let me keep on sleeping !
come with me , please .
i wish you'd do what i ask !
madam , i will .
oh , say it , and mean it !
no , i'm telling you , put on this robe and beard .
make him think you're sir topas the priest .
be quick .
meanwhile , i'll get sir toby .
here come the conspirators .
god bless you , mr .
priest .
go to him , sir topas .
the fool's a good actor .
a good fool .
sir topas , sir topas , good sir topas , please go find my lady olivia , get out , demon !
why are you bothering this poor man !
can't you talk about anything besides ladies ?
you should be ashamed of yourself , satan , you liar !
i'm being gentle with you , because i'm one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself .
you call this house dark ?
dark as hell , sir topas .
but it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls , and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal .
but you're still complaining of darkness and a bad view ?
i'm not insane , sir topas .
i'm telling you , this house is dark .
you're wrong , you madman .
there's no darkness except ignorance , and you're more ignorant than the egyptians during the plague of fog .
i tell you , this house is as dark as ignorance .
i'm no more insane than you are , and i'll prove it .
ask me any commonsense question .
what was the philosopher pythagoras's belief about wild birds ?
that our grandmother's soul could end up inhabiting a bird .
what do you think of his belief ?
i respect the soul very much , so i disagree with his belief .
well then , goodbye .
stay in the dark .
i'll only admit that you're sane when you agree with pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother's soul .
goodbye .
sir topas , sir topas !
the brilliant sir topas !
i can do anything !
you could've done this without your beard and gown .
he couldn't see you .
now talk to him in your own voice , and tell me how he is .
i wish this trick would be over .
i'm in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn't be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion .
come to my room later on .
fool !
fool !
fool , i say !
good fool , good jester , i'll make it worth your while if you get me a candle , and a pen , ink and paper .
you have my word as a gentleman that i'll always be grateful to you .
master malvolio ?
yes , good fool .
as sane as me ?
then you really are insane , if you're no saner than a fool .
sir topas !
fool , fool , hey , fool !
please , sir , be quiet .
what do you want to say , sir ?
be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper .
i tell you , i'm as sane as any man in illyria .
if only you were , sir .
i swear i am .
get me some ink , paper , and a candle .
you'll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before .
i'll help you .
but tell me honestly , are you sure you're not insane ?
or are you just pretending ?
believe me , i'm not .
i'm telling the truth .
i'll never believe a madman until i can see his brains .
but i'll get you a candle and paper and ink .
fool , i'll repay you for this favor .
please , hurry .
this is the air , that's the glorious sun .
where's antonio , then ?
i didn't find him at the elephant .
but he'd been there before me , and they told me he'd gone out looking for me .
i could really use his advice right now .
there's something going on that's not what it seems .
but here she comes .
i'll follow the priest and go with you ; and after i've sworn to be faithful , i'll be faithful forever .
then lead the way , father .
if you're my friend , you'll let me see his letter .
dear mr . fabian , do me another favor first .
anything .
don't ask to see this letter .
my friends , are you all lady olivia's servants ?
yes , sir , we're part of her entourage .
i know you .
how are you , my friend ?
i'm better off because of my enemies , and worse off because of my friends .
you're better off because of your friends .
no , sir , worse off .
how can that be ?
by the way , i'm going home tomorrow , sir toby .
what does you'd have a great hairstyle if you had .
why , would that have fixed my hair ?
oh , no question , it won't style itself .
but my hair looks good anyway , doesn't it ?
it looks great .
it hangs like an old worn-out mop .
listen , i'm going home tomorrow , sir toby .
that duke who lives nearby is courting her .
i've heard her say that .
so cheer up , there's still hope for you , man .
well , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that i am an idiot .
my enemies help me understand myself better , which is an advantage , and my friends help me lie about myself , which is a disadvantage .
so if four negatives make two affirmatives , i'm worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes .
that's excellent .
don't say that , unless you want to be one of my friends .
that's a nice hand you dealt me .
but if it's not double-dealing , sir , i wish you'd deal me another .
oh , you're a naughty one , encouraging double-dealing .
well , i'll commit the sin of double-dealing , and deal you a second coin .
here it is .
and maybe a third ?
the three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing , and the church bells chime , one , two , three .
you can't get any more money out of me right now .
if you tell your lady i'm here to speak with her , and bring her out with you when you come back , you might make me more generous .
well then , sing a lullaby to your generosity : it'll nap until i come back .
but don't think i'm doing this because i'm greedy .
i'll be back soon to wake up your generosity .
here comes the man who rescued me , sir .
i remember his face well .
though the last time i saw him it was black from the smoke of war .
he was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small .
orsino , this is the same antonio who took the
but then he said strange things to me .
i don't know what else it could be .
but you're a famous pirate !
orsino , sir , please don't call me those names .
i was never a thief or a pirate , though i admit i was your enemy for good reasons .
i rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning .
he was a wreck , almost past hope .
i saved his life and gave him my love , without reservation .
how is that possible ?
ah , the countess is coming !
an angel is walking on earth .
what can i give you that you want , my lord , except the one thing you can't have ?
cesario , you missed your appointment with me .
madam ?
dearest olivia , what do you have to say for yourself , cesario ? , my lord , please , my lord wants to speak .
it's my duty to be quiet .
are you still so cruel ?
i am still so faithful , my lord .
what , faithful to being mean and nasty ?
i breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered , what more am i supposed to do ?
you can do whatever you want as long as it's socially appropriate .
come with me , boy .
and i would die a thousand deaths cheerfully , if it made your life easier .
where's cesario going ?
that's the truth .
who tricked you ?
who treated you badly ?
have you completely forgotten ?
has it been so long ?
call the priest .
go where , my lord ? , cesario , my husband , stay here .
husband ?
yes , husband .
can he deny it ?
are you her husband , boy ?
no , my lord , not me .
but don't be afraid , cesario .
be the person you know you are , and you'll be as powerful as this person you fear .
oh , hello , father !
father , could i please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man ?
my lord , i swear to you , oh , don't swear !
keep a little bit of honesty , even if you're afraid .
for the love of god , call a doctor !
sir toby needs help right away .
what's the matter ?
he cut my head and gave sir toby a bloody head , too .
for the love of god , help us !
i'd give forty pounds to be safe at home right now .
who did this , sir andrew ?
the count's messenger , cesario .
we thought he was a coward , but he fights like a devil .
my cesario ?
anything i did to you , i did it because sir toby made me .
why are you talking like this ?
i never hurt you .
if a bloody head counts as a hurt , then you hurt me .
apparently you think there's nothing unusual about a bloody head .
here comes sir toby , limping .
he'll tell you more of the story .
if he hadn't been drunk , he would've really roughed you up .
hello , sir !
how are you ?
it doesn't matter how i am : he hurt me , and that's that .
oh , he's drunk , sir toby , for a whole hour now .
his eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning .
then he's no good .
i hate no-good drunks .
take him away !
who did this to him ?
i'll help you , sir toby .
will you help me ? , what an ass and a fool , a gullible no-good idiot !
get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated .
but please forgive me , darling , for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently .
one face , one voice , one way of dressing , but two people !
antonio , oh my dear antonio !
i've been so tortured since i lost track of you !
are you sebastian ?
do you have any doubts , antonio ?
how did you divide yourself in two ?
these two people are as identical as two halves of an apple .
which one is sebastian ?
how unbelievable !
sebastian was my father's name , and my brother was named sebastian too .
i am a spirit , yes , since i have a soul .
"if you were a woman , i'd hug you now and cry , and say "" welcome back , drowned viola ! "" my father had a mole on his forehead ."
mine did too .
he died on viola's thirteenth birthday .
all right , i'll stay another month .
ah , i'm an odd kind of guy .
sometimes all i want to do is see plays and go out dancing .
are you good at those kinds of things ?
why do you hide these things ?
why do you keep these talents behind a curtain ?
are they likely to get dusty ?
why don't you go off to church dancing one way , and come home dancing another way ?
i wouldn't even pee without dancing a waltz .
what are you thinking ?
is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments ?
look how shapely your legs are .
that's true .
why not ?
weren't we both born under taurus ?
oh , i remember that very clearly !
it's true , he died on the day my sister turned thirteen .
give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman's clothing .
the captain who brought me to shore has my women's clothes .
for some reason he's in prison now on some legal technicality , on malvolio's orders .
he'll release him .
i was so crazy myself that i forgot all about him .
well , he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation .
he's written you a letter .
i would've given it to you this morning , but a madman's letters aren't gospel , so it doesn't matter much if i'm a bit late .
open it and read it .
there's a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman .
why are you talking like that ?
are you insane ?
no , madam , i'm just reading an insane letter .
if you want things done in the right way , you'll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice .
no , please , read it like a sane person .
i will , my lady , but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy .
so listen up , princess .
i swear to god , madam , you've wronged me , and i'll tell the whole world .
you've shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me , but i'm as sane as you are .
i don't care what you think of me .
i'm going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you've caused me .
"signed , the poorly treated malvolio . "" did he write this ?"
yes , madam .
set him free .
fabian , bring him here .
i accept that offer happily , madam .
is this the madman ?
yes , my lord .
how are you , malvolio ?
madam , you've treated me badly , very badly .
i did , malvolio ?
no .
tell me why you did it .
i'm sorry , malvolio , but this isn't my writing , though i admit it looks like mine .
it's definitely maria's handwriting .
now that i think about it , maria was the one who first told me you were insane .
i promise .
"well , you know , "" some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them . "" anyway , i was part of the trick , sir ."
he really was tricked horribly .
go after him and try to calm him down a little .
he still hasn't told us about the captain .
cesario , come here .
taurus !
that governs the torso and heart , doesn't it ?
no , the legs and thighs .
let me see you dance .
he's only known you for three days , but he's already treating you like a close friend .
no , not at all .
thanks for telling me .
here comes the duke now .
has anyone seen cesario ?
be loud and obnoxious .
i don't think so , my lord .
my boy , it's true .
anyone who says you're a man must not notice how young you are .
i know you're the right person for this job .
i'll do my best to make this lady love you .
give me too much of it , so i'll get sick of it and stop loving .
oh , it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets , taking their scent with it .
it doesn't sound as sweet as it did before .
love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it .
do you want to go hunting , my lord ?
hunting what , curio ?
lady olivia will have you executed for not showing up .
so let her execute me .
how do you know ?
well , he'll be dead , so he won't see anything .
that's a lame answer .
where , good miss mary ?
from soldiers .
well , we all have our special gifts .
but still , she's going to kill you for being gone so long .
you've made up your mind , then ?
well , go along now .
you'd be the funniest person in illyria , if sir toby ever stopped drinking .
shut up , you troublemaker , no more of that .
here comes my lady .
get that fool out of here .
didn't you hear her , guys ?
get the lady out of here .
oh , go away , you're a boring fool .
i don't want to have anything to do with you anymore .
besides , you've gotten unreliable .
if he can not , let the tailor mend him .
anything that's mended is only patched up .
a good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin .
if this logic works , that's great .
if not , what can you do about it ?
i told them to take oh , what a big mistake !
please let me prove you're a fool .
can you do that ?
easily , madam .
i'll have to ask you some questions , madam .
please answer , my good little student .
i'm listening to you only because i've got nothing better to do .
my dear madam , why are you in mourning ?
my dear fool , because my brother died .
i think his soul's in hell , my lady .
i know his soul's in heaven , fool .
then you're a fool for being sad that your brother's soul is in heaven .
take away this fool , gentlemen .
what do you think of this fool , malvolio ?
isn't he getting funnier ?
yes , and he'll keep getting funnier till he dies .
old age always makes people act funny , even wise people , but fools more than anybody .
i hope you go senile soon , sir , so you can become a more foolish fool !
sir toby would bet a fortune that i'm not smart , but he wouldn't bet two cents that you're not a fool .
what do you say to that , malvolio ?
i'm surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker .
the other day i saw him defeated in a
i swear , anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester's apprentice .
malvolio , your vanity is damaging your good taste .
you speak so highly of fools !
madam , there's a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you .
was he sent by count orsino ?
i don't know , madam .
he's a good-looking young man , and there are a lot of people with him .
who's talking to him now ?
sir toby , madam , your relative .
he talks nothing but nonsense .
if he's got a message from the count , tell him i'm sick , or not home .
who's that at the gate , uncle ?
a gentleman .
a gentleman ?
what gentleman ?
there's some gentleman out there . , good sir toby !
nonsense .
i defy brain-death !
i told you , someone's at the gate .
yes , but who is he ?
let him be the devil if he wants to , i don't care .
god will protect me .
tell me what a drunk is like , fool .
he's a fool , a madman , and a drowned man .
the first drink makes him a fool , the second makes him crazy , and the third drowns him .
go take care of him .
madam , that young man out there says he's got to speak to you .
i told him you were sick .
he claimed he knew that , and that's why he's come to speak with you .
i told him you were asleep .
he claimed to know that already too , and said that's the reason he's come to speak with you .
what can i say to him , lady ?
he's got an answer for everything .
tell him he's not going to speak with me .
just a man , like any other .
but what's he like ?
he insists he'll speak with you whether you want him to or not .
how old is he ?
not old enough to be a man , but not young enough to be a boy .
he's somewhere between boy and man .
he's very handsome and speaks well , but he's very young .
he looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding .
show him in .
call in my maid .
maria , our lady wants you .
give me my veil .
come , put it over my face .
which one of you is the lady of the house ?
you can speak to me .
i represent her .
what do you want ?
what stunning , exquisite , and unmatchable beauty , but please , tell me if you're the lady of the house , because i've never seen her .
i'd hate to waste my speech on the wrong person , because it's very well written and i spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it .
beautiful ladies , please don't treat me badly .
i'm very sensitive , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings .
where do you come from , sir ?
i'm sorry , but i memorized what i'm supposed to say here today , and that question isn't part of the speech i learned .
please , my lady , just confirm that you're the lady of the house so i can get on with my speech .
are you an actor ?
no , madam .
but i swear i'm not the person i'm playing .
are you the lady of the house ?
i am , unless i somehow stole this role .
if you're the lady of the house , then it's true you're stealing your role , because what's yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself .
but that's not part of what i'm supposed to say .
i'll go on with my speech praising you , and then i'll get to the point .
get to the point now .
i'll let you get away with skipping the praise .
that's too bad , because i spent a long time memorizing it , and it's poetic .
that means it's more likely to be fake .
please , keep it to yourself .
if you're just insane , then get out of here .
ready to set sail , sir ?
the door's right here .
tell me what you want .
tell me what it's about .
it's about you .
i'm not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash .
i'm coming in peace .
but you began so rudely .
who are you ?
what do you want ?
what's going on ?
what have you heard from her ?
take me to the garden .
who i am and what i want are a secret .
everyone , please leave us alone for a moment .
"most sweet lady , oh , "" sweet "" !"
where's the passage of holy scripture that you're basing your sermon on ?
in orsino's heart .
in his heart ?
in what chapter and verse of his heart ?
the table of contents says it's in the first chapter of his heart .
oh , i've read that .
that's not holy , it's heresy .
do you have anything else to say ?
madam , please let me see your face .
has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face ?
you're overstepping your bounds now .
but i'll open the curtain and let you see the picture .
look , sir , this is a portrait of me as i am at this particular moment .
it's pretty well done , isn't it ?
wind and rain can't wash it off .
oh , i'd never be that cruel .
i'll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part .
but you'd still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil .
my lord loves you .
how does he love me ?
your lord knows what i think .
i can't love him .
i know he's noble , rich , young , and with a fine reputation .
people say he's generous , well educated , and brave , and he's very attractive .
but i just can't love him .
what would you do about it ?
from that cabin i'd call out to my soul .
i'd write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night .
not bad ; you might accomplish something .
but i'm still fairly high-ranking .
i'm a gentleman .
go back to your lord .
i can't love him .
tell him not to send any more messengers , unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news .
goodbye .
thanks for your trouble .
here's some money for you .
i'm not a paid messenger , my lady .
keep your money .
it's my master who's not getting the reward he deserves , not me .
goodbye , you beautiful , cruel woman .
but i'm still fairly high-ranking .
ah , no .
calm down , calm down .
if only his lord were more like him .
how strange i'm feeling !
can someone fall in love this quickly ?
come here !
at your service , madam .
run after that obnoxious messenger , the duke's servant .
he insisted on leaving this ring with me whether i wanted it or not .
madam , i will .
i don't know what i'm doing .
fate , do your work .
we human beings don't control our own destinies .
what is fated to happen must happen .
no , i'd rather you stayed here .
at least tell me where you're going .
honestly , i can't .
i'm just wandering , with no particular destination .
but i know you'd never force me to tell you things i don't want to , so i should be polite and tell you what i can .
he left behind myself and my twin sister , who was born in the same hour as me .
if god had been willing , i wish we had died in the same hour too !
an hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned .
how tragic !
although many people said she looked like me , she was considered beautiful .
she's been drowned in salty sea water , and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again .
oh , antonio , i'm sorry i caused you so much trouble .
please let me be your servant so i can be with you .
i like you very much .
i'm going to count orsino's court .
goodbye .
i wish you all the best .
if i didn't have so many enemies in orsino's court , i'd go join you there .
but who cares .
excuse me , weren't you with countess olivia just now ?
yes , sir .
i've only made it this far since i left her place , walking at a moderate pace .
she's sending this ring back to you , sir .
you should've saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself .
here , take the ring .
she took that ring from me .
i won't take it back .
you threw it at her rudely , and she wants you to take it back .
i didn't give her any ring .
what's she trying to say ?
i hope she doesn't have a crush on me !
it's true she looked at me a lot , in fact , she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted , and couldn't really finish her sentences very well .
oh , i really think she loves me !
creet .
i'm the man she wants .
if that's true , which it is , she might as well be in love with a dream , the poor lady .
ah , how will this all turn out ?
what can possibly fix this situation ?
oh , only time can sort out this mess .
i can't figure it out by myself !
come on , sir andrew .
and the doctors say it's healthy to get up early , i don't know what the doctors say .
all i know is that staying up late is staying up late .
a false conclusion .
i hate your logic as much as i hate an empty drinking cup .
you're a smart guy .
so we should eat and drink .
maria !
bring us some wine !
look , here comes the fool .
hello , my friends !
what a pretty picture , three fools all together .
hello , you idiot .
sing us a song .
what country is this , friends ?
this is illyria , lady .
and what am i supposed to do in illyria ?
my brother is in heaven .
or maybe there's a chance he didn't drown . , what do you think , sailors ?
it was a total fluke that you yourself were saved .
oh , my poor brother !
but maybe by some fluke he was saved too .
it's possible , ma'am .
don't give up yet .
i was born and raised less than three hours from here .
i swear , this fool has an excellent singing voice .
my girlfriend has beautiful white hands , and great warriors aren't ha , ha !
would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?
a love song , a love song .
yes , yes .
i'm not interested in being good .
that was excellent , really excellent .
good , very good .
a beautiful voice , i swear .
his breath stinks .
yes , it stinks very sweetly .
should we sing a round to wake up the night owl ?
should we do that ?
let's go for it .
absolutely .
"let's dance to "" you jerk . "" you mean , "" shut up , you jerk "" ?"
so i'll be forced to call you a jerk , sir andrew .
"it starts , "" shut up . "" i'll never be able to start if i shut up ."
that's true .
but come on , start .
you're making a terrible racket out here !
lady olivia told her servant malvolio to kick you out of the house .
for god's sake , shut up !
are you all crazy ?
what's wrong with you ?
are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners , or because you're just stupid ?
don't you have any respect for anything ?
we respected the beat of the song , sir .
so shut up !
sir toby , i've got to be frank with you .
my lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you're a relative , she doesn't approve of your behavior .
if you can shape up , you're welcome to stay in the house .
if you can't , and would prefer to leave , she's very willing to say goodbye to you .
no , good sir toby .
that's out of tune , sir .
you lie .
they certainly will .
you're right .
go and wiggle your ears !
i could challenge him to a duel and then not show up .
do that .
i'll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf .
or i'll deliver your insults to his face .
dear sir toby , don't do anything rash tonight .
ever since the duke's messenger visited olivia , she's been upset .
as for monsieur malvolio , let me take care of him .
i know i can do it .
oh , i'll beat him up for that !
"i don't have any "" brilliant "" reason for it , but i have a good enough reason ."
that's the weakness i'll use to get revenge on him .
what are you going to do ?
i can make my handwriting look just like lady olivia's : she
excellent !
i like it too .
he'll think these letters are from olivia and that she's in love with him .
yes , that's the idea .
he's going to look like a total idiot .
absolutely , you idiot .
this is going to be great !
it's going to be fun , i promise .
i know my medicine will work on him .
i'll have you two hide , and the fool too , right where he'll find the letter .
watch his reaction .
meanwhile , let's go to bed and dream about this .
good night .
good night , you amazing woman , you .
she's a fine woman , all right .
she's a good little woman , and she adores me .
what about it ?
someone adored me once , too .
let's go to bed , knight .
tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you .
i know i will too , if it's the last thing i do .
it's too late to go to bed now .
play me some music .
sir , the person who should sing that song isn't here .
who was it ?
he's somewhere else in the house .
you're absolutely right .
i'd bet my life that , as young as you are , you've fallen in love with someone .
haven't you , boy ?
a little bit .
what kind of woman is she ?
she's a lot like you .
she's not good enough for you , then .
how old is she ?
about as old as you are , my lord .
that's definitely too old .
a woman should always pick an older man .
i think you're right , sir .
so find someone younger to love , or you won't be able to maintain your feelings .
women are like roses : the moment their beauty is in full bloom , it's about to decay .
that's true .
it's too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection !
who's the ruler here ?
a duke who is noble in name and character .
what's his name ?
orsino .
orsino .
i've heard my father mention him .
when i first heard about him , he was still a bachelor .
but there was a rumor , you know , people always gossip about royalty , that he was in love with the beautiful olivia .
who's she ?
i wish i could work for that lady !
are you ready , sir ?
no trouble , sir .
i like singing .
then i'll pay you for doing what you like .
you may leave .
goodbye .
all the rest of you can leave too .
cesario , go visit that cruel olivia one more time .
tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world , and has nothing to do with her property .
but if she can't love you , sir ?
i refuse to accept that .
but you have to .
just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love olivia .
shouldn't she just accept that ?
no woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion i feel .
no woman's heart is big enough to hold all my love .
they eat too much and get indigestion and nausea .
it's as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea , and it can swallow as much as the sea can .
don't compare a woman's love for a man with my love for olivia .
yes , but i know , what do you know ?
i know a lot about the love women can feel for men .
actually , their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are .
my father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that i might love you , if i were a woman .
and what's her story ?
there was no story , my lord .
doesn't that sound like true love ?
but did your sister die of love ?
i am the only daughter in my father's family , and all the brothers too , but i'm not completely sure about that .
anyway , sir , should i go see the lady ?
come along with us , signor fabian .
i'm coming , don't worry .
if i miss this , let me be boiled alive .
won't you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated ?
i'll be thrilled .
you know , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when i arranged a bear-baiting here .
we'll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry , and we'll mock him till he's black and blue .
won't we , sir andrew ?
if we don't , it'll be the biggest disappointment of our lives .
here comes the little villain herself .
how are you , my golden girl ?
hide behind the boxwood hedge , all three of you .
malvolio's coming down the path .
he's been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour .
this letter's going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot .
