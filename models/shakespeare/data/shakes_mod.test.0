a jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution .
i love rich capulet's daughter .
we're bound to each other in every possible way , except we need you to marry us .
i'll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now i'm begging you : please , agree to marry us today .
holy saint francis , this is a drastic change !
have you given up so quickly on rosaline , whom you loved so much ?
then young men love with their eyes , not with their hearts .
the groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears .
there's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet .
if you were ever yourself , and this sadness was yours , you and your sadness were all for rosaline .
and now you've changed ?
then repeat this after me : you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .
you scolded me often for loving rosaline .
i scolded you for obsessing about her , not for loving her , my student .
and you told me to bury my love .
i didn't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .
please , i beg you , don't scold me .
the other girl did not love me .
oh , she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means .
but come on , inconsistent young man , come with me .
let's get out of here .
i'm in a rush .
go wisely and slowly .
those who rush stumble and fall .
where the devil can romeo be ?
didn't he come home last night ?
not to his father's house .
i asked a servant .
that fair-skinned , hard-hearted hussy , rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane .
tybalt , old capulet's nephew , has sent a letter to romeo's father's house .
i bet it's a challenge .
romeo will answer the challenge .
any man who knows how to write can answer a letter .
no , romeo will respond to the letter's writer , telling him whether he accepts the challenge .
oh , poor romeo !
is he man enough at this point to face off with tybalt ?
why , what's tybalt's story ?
he knows what ?
he looks skinny , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he hasn't got his girl .
o flesh , flesh , you've turned pale and weak like a fish .
now he's ready for
good morning to you both .
what do you mean i faked you out ?
you gave us the slip , sir , the slip .
can't you understand what i'm saying ?
the right .
my employer is as good as yours .
but he's not better than mine .
well then .
you lie .
gregory , remember how to slash .
what ?
come break this up , benvolio .
i'm losing this duel of wits .
keep going , keep going , or i'll declare myself the winner .
you have more wild goose in one of your jokes than i have in five of mine .
was i even close to you in the chase for the goose ?
you were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose .
i'll bite you on the ear for that joke .
no , good goose , don't bite me .
your joke is a very bitter apple .
your humor is a spicy sauce .
then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?
oh , that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard .
"i stretch my joke for that word "" fat . "" if you add that word to the word "" goose , "" it shows that you are a fat goose ."
why , isn't all this joking better than groaning about love ?
now you're sociable .
now you're romeo .
oh , you're wrong .
i would have made it short .
i had come to the deepest part of my tale , and i planned to say nothing more on the topic .
here's something good .
there's two , a man and a woman .
peter !
i'm at your service .
give me my fan , peter .
good morning , gentlemen .
good afternoon , fair lady .
is it now afternoon ?
it's not earlier than that , i tell you .
the get out of here !
what kind of man are you ?
i'm a man , my lady , that god has made for himself to ruin .
i swear , you speak the truth .
"for himself to ruin , "" he says ."
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i can find young romeo ?
i can tell you , but young romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him .
i am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , or worse .
you speak well .
is the worst well ?
very well taken , i believe , very wise .
she will a pimp !
i've found it out .
what have you found out ?
romeo , are you going to your father's for lunch ?
let's go there .
i'll follow after you .
he says more in one minute than he does in a whole month .
if he says anything against me , i'll humble him , even if he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .
if i can't do it myself , i'll find someone who can .
that dirty rat !
i'm not one of his sluts .
i'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .
i didn't see anybody use you for kicks .
if i had seen something like that , i would have quickly pulled out my weapon .
believe me , i'll draw my sword as quick as any other man if i see a fight starting and the law is on my side .
now , i swear , i'm so angry that i'm shaking all over .
that rotten scoundrel !
nurse , give my regards to to your lady .
i swear to you , you have a good heart , and believe me , i'll tell her that .
lord , lord , she'll be a happy woman .
what are you going to tell her , nurse ?
you're not paying attention to me .
at friar lawrence's cell she can make confession and be married .
wait good nurse .
within an hour , one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .
goodbye .
be honest and helpful , and i'll repay you for your efforts .
goodbye .
sing my praises to your mistress .
may god in heaven bless you .
now please listen , sir .
what do you have to say , my dear nurse ?
can your man keep a secret ?
"haven't you ever heard the saying , "" two can conspire to put one away "" ?"
i assure you , my man is as true as steel .
well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
lord , lord , when she was a little baby , oh , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named paris , who would be happy to claim her as his own .
i make her angry sometimes by saying that paris is more handsome than you are .
but when i say so , i swear she turns white as a sheet .
"don't "" yes , nurse , what about that ?"
"they both begin with the letter "" r . "" ah , you jokester , that's the dog's name ."
give my compliments to your lady .
yes , a thousand times .
peter !
i'm ready .
i sent the nurse at nine o'clock .
maybe she can't find him .
that can't be .
oh , she's slow !
love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .
that's three hours since nine o'clock , but she hasn't come back .
if she was young and passionate , she'd move as fast as a ball .
my words would bounce her to my sweet love , and his words would bounce her back to me .
but a lot of old people act like they're already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .
oh sweet nurse , what news do you bring ?
have you spoken to him ?
send your man away .
peter , wait for me at the gate .
now , good sweet nurse , oh lord , why do you look so sad ?
even if the news is sad , tell me with a smile on your face .
if the news is good , you're ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that .
i am tired .
leave me alone for a minute .
oh my , my bones ache so much .
i wish you had my bones , and i had your news .
can't you wait for a moment ?
don't you see that i'm out of breath ?
how can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?
the excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself .
is the news good or bad ?
answer that question .
tell me if it's good or bad , and i'll wait for the details .
tell me so i can be satisfied .
is it good or bad ?
well , you have made a foolish choice .
you don't know how to pick a man .
romeo ?
no , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man's , and his legs are prettier , and as for his hands and feet and body , they're not much to speak of , and yet they're beyond compare .
he's not the most polite man in the world , but , believe me , he's gentle as a lamb .
well , do what you want .
be good .
have you had lunch yet ?
no , i haven't had lunch .
everything you told me i already knew .
what does he say about our marriage ?
what about that ?
my head is pounding .
my back aches too ,
believe me , i'm sorry you're in pain .
sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what did my love romeo say ?
your love says , like an honorable gentleman , who is courteous , kind , handsome , and , i believe , virtuous , where is your mother ?
where is my mother ?
why , she's inside .
where else would she be ?
your answer is so strange !
your love says , like an honorable gentleman , ' where is your mother ?
are you this impatient ?
come on , you're being ridiculous !
is this the cure for my aching bones ?
from now on , take care of your messages yourself .
you're making such a fuss .
come on , what did romeo say ?
do you have permission to go out and take confession today ?
i do .
then hurry up and rush over to friar lawrence's cell .
there's a husband there who's waiting to make you his wife .
now i see the blood rushing to your cheeks .
you blush bright red as soon as you hear any news .
go to the church .
your love will use it to climb up to your window while it's dark .
go .
i'll go to lunch .
you go to friar lawrence's cell .
i'm only trying to keep the peace .
either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .
what ?
i hate the word peace like i hate hell , all montagues , and you .
let's go at it , coward !
use your clubs and spears !
hit them !
beat them down !
down with the capulets !
down with the montagues !
what's this noise ?
i want my sword .
old montague is here , and he's waving his sword around just to make me mad .
capulet , you villain !
you're not taking one step toward an enemy .
wish me luck .
thank you , dear nurse .
amen , amen .
but whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy i feel with one look at her .
therefore , love each other in moderation .
that is the key to long-lasting love .
too fast is as bad as too slow .
here comes the lady .
oh , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life .
that's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .
romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us .
i'll give him equal thanks , so we're even .
ah , juliet if you're as happy as i am , and you're better with words , tell me about the happiness you imagine we'll have in our marriage .
i can imagine more than i can say , i have more on my mind than words .
come , come with me , and we'll do the job quickly .
i'm begging you , good mercutio , let's call it a day .
"you're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , "" i pray i never have to use you . "" by the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all ."
am i really like one of those guys ?
come on , you can be as angry as any guy in italy when you're in the mood .
and what about that ?
if there were two men like you , pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other .
you would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard .
you'll fight with a man who's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes .
only you would look for a fight like that .
your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting .
you started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .
didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
and with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?
and yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint !
if i were in the habit of fighting the way you are , my life insurance rates would be sky high .
your life insurance ?
that's foolish .
oh great , here come the capulets .
well , well , i don't care .
put it together with something else .
make it a word and a blow .
you'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason .
can't you find a reason without my giving you one ?
mercutio , you hang out with romeo .
"hang out ? "" who do you think we are , musicians in a band ?"
if we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise .
we're talking here in a public place .
either go someplace private , or talk it over rationally , or else just go away .
out here everybody can see us .
men's eyes were made to see things , so let them watch .
i won't move to please anybody .
well , may peace be with you .
here comes my man , the man i'm looking for .
he's not your man .
tybalt , i have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage i should feel and excuse that insult .
i am no villain .
so , goodbye .
i can tell that you don't know who i am .
boy , your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me .
so now turn and draw your sword .
and so , good capulet , which is a name i love like my own name , you should be satisfied with what i say .
this calm submission is dishonorable and vile .
what do you want from me ?
will you pull your sword out of its sheath ?
hurry up , or i'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn .
i'll fight you .
noble mercutio , put your sword away .
let's get away , tybalt .
i've been hurt .
may a plague curse both your families .
i'm finished .
did he get away clean ?
what , are you hurt ?
but it's enough .
where is my page ?
have courage , man .
the wound can't be that bad .
no , it's not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door , but it's enough .
ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
i'm done for in this world , i believe .
may a plague strike both your houses .
i can't believe that dog , that rat , that mouse , that cat could scratch me to death !
that braggart , punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual !
why the hell did you come in between us ?
he struck me from under your arm .
i thought it was the right thing to do .
take me inside some house , benvolio , or i'll pass out .
may a plague strike both your families !
they've turned me into food for worms .
i'm done for .
curse your families !
oh romeo , romeo , brave mercutio is dead !
here comes the furious tybalt back again .
he's alive and victorious , and mercutio's dead ?
either you , or i , or both of us have to go with him .
wretched boy , you hung out with him here , and you're going to go to heaven with him .
this fight will decide who dies .
romeo , get out of here .
the citizens are around , and tybalt is dead .
don't stand there shocked .
the prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught .
so get out of here !
why are you waiting ?
the man who killed mercutio , which way did he go ?
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ?
tybalt is lying over there .
speak , nephew .
were you here when it started ?
where are the evil men who started this fight ?
oh , noble prince , i can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight .
he killed your relative , brave mercutio , and then young romeo killed him .
tybalt was my nephew !
he was my brother's son !
oh cousin , cousin !
benvolio , who started this fight ?
"romeo cried out , "" stop , my friends ."
"break it up . "" then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down ."
before i could break up the fight , tybalt was killed .
romeo ran away when tybalt fell dead .
benvolio is part of the montague family .
he's not telling the truth .
there were twenty montagues fighting in this awful riot , and together those twenty could only kill one man .
you , prince , are the man who can give me justice .
romeo killed tybalt .
romeo must die .
romeo killed tybalt .
who should now pay the price for mercutio's life ?
his crime did justice's job by taking tybalt's life .
i'm involved in your rivalry .
i'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .
i won't listen to your pleas or excuses .
you can't get out of trouble by praying or crying , so don't bother .
take away this body , and do what i say .
showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders .
or else love is blind , and its best time is the night .
i wish night would come , like a widow dressed in black , so i can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity .
let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .
come , night .
come , romeo .
you're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven .
his face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun .
is that the rope ladder romeo told you to pick up ?
yes , yes , this is the rope ladder .
oh my , what's the news ?
why do you look so upset ?
he's dead .
we're ruined , lady , we're ruined !
what an awful day !
can god be so jealous and hateful ?
romeo is hateful , even though god isn't .
what kind of devil are you to torture me like this ?
this is as bad as the tortures of hell .
has romeo killed himself ?
"just say "" yes "" and i will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye ."
"if he's been killed , say "" yes . "" if not , say "" no . "" these short words will determine my joy or my pain ."
i'll send my eyes to prison , and they'll never be free to look at anything again .
i'll give my vile body back to the earth .
oh , tybalt , tybalt , he was the best friend i had .
i wish i had not lived long enough to see him die .
has romeo been killed , and is tybalt dead too ?
tybalt was my dearest cousin .
tybalt is dead , and romeo has been banished .
oh god , did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood ?
it did , it did .
curse the day this happened , but it did .
oh , he's like a snake disguised as a flower .
did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ?
he's a raven with the feathers of the dove .
oh nature , what were you doing in hell ?
was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover ?
ah , where's my servant ? , give me some brandy . , these griefs , these pains , these sorrows make me old .
shame on romeo !
i hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that !
he was not born to be shameful .
he deserves only honor , complete honor .
oh , i was such a beast to be angry at him .
are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin ?
but why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?
probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .
all this is comforting news .
why , then , should i cry ?
i would be glad to forget about it , but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds .
"tybalt is dead , and romeo has been banished . """
that banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand tybalts .
tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all .
"it would have been better if , after she said , "" tybalt's dead , "" she told me my mother or my father , or both , were gone ."
"but to say that tybalt's dead and then say , "" romeo has been banished . "" to say that is like saying that my father , my mother , tybalt , romeo , and juliet have all been killed , they're all dead ."
"romeo has been banished . "" that news brings infinite death ."
no words can express the pain .
where are my father and my mother , nurse ?
they are crying and moaning over tybalt's corpse .
are you going to join them ?
i'll bring you there .
are they washing out his wounds with their tears ?
i'll cry my tears for romeo's banishment when their tears are dry .
pick up this rope ladder .
he made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but i am a virgin , and i will die a virgin and a widow .
and death , not romeo , can take my virginity !
go to your bedroom .
i'll find romeo to comfort you .
i know where he is .
listen , your romeo will be here tonight .
i'll go to him .
he's hiding out in friar lawrence's cell .
romeo , come out .
come out , you frightened man .
father , what's the news ?
you know too much about suffering .
i have news for you about the prince's punishment .
is the prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday ?
ha , banishment ?
"be merciful and say "" death . "" exile is much worse than death ."
"don't say "" banishment . "" from now on , you are banished from verona ."
you should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide .
there is no world for me outside the walls of verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .
so to be banished from verona is like being banished from the world , and being banished from the world is death .
calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while i'm being murdered .
oh , deadly sin !
oh , rude and unthankful boy !
it's torture , not mercy .
flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than romeo .
flies can kiss her , but i must flee the city .
flies are like free men , but i have been banished .
and yet you say that exile is not death ?
did you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you could use to kill me quickly , nothing so disgraceful , except banishment ?
oh friar , damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell .
they howl about banishment .
if you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you're my friend , how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?
you foolish madman , listen to me for a moment .
your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before i got here .
i drew my sword to part them .
as we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , until the prince came and broke everyone up .
oh , where's romeo ?
have you seen him today ?
i'm glad he wasn't here for this fight .
i headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .
he's been seen there many mornings , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .
but as soon as the sun rises in the east , my sad son comes home to escape the light .
oh , you're just going to talk about banishment again .
don't say anything else .
oh , so madmen like you are also deaf .
how should madmen hear , if wise men can't even see ?
let me talk to you about your situation .
you can't talk about something that you don't feel .
if you were as young as i am , if you were in love with juliet , if you had just married her an hour ago , if then you murdered tybalt , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might talk about it .
get up .
somebody's knocking .
hide yourself , good romeo .
i won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyes .
why are you knocking so hard ?
where do you come from ?
what do you want ?
oh , holy friar , oh , tell me , holy friar , where is my lady's husband ?
where's romeo ?
oh , he's acting just like juliet , just like her .
oh painful sympathy !
she's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
stand up if you're really a man .
for juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand up .
why should you fall into so deep a moan ?
nurse !
ah sir , ah sir .
well , death is the end for everybody .
were you talking about juliet ?
how is she ?
where is she ?
how is she doing ?
what does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?
she's calling out my name as if i were a bullet murdering her , just like i murdered her relative .
tell me , friar , in what part of my body is my name embedded ?
tell me , so i can cut it out of myself .
are you a man ?
your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast .
you have amazed me .
i swear by my holy order , i thought you were smarter and more rational than this .
have you killed tybalt ?
why do you complain about your birth , the heavens , and the earth ?
you have so much natural talent , but like someone who hoards money , you use none of your talent for the right purpose , not your body , not your love , not your mind .
get up , man !
your juliet is alive .
tybalt wanted to kill you , but you killed tybalt .
be happy that you're alive .
you have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy .
but like a misbehaved , sullen girl , you're whining about your bad luck and your love .
go be with your love , as it was decided at your wedding .
climb up to her bedroom and comfort her .
give my regards to your lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed .
romeo is coming .
o lord , i could stay here all night listening to such good advice .
educated men are so impressive !
do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me .
here , sir , this is a ring she asked me to give you .
hurry up , it's getting late .
this makes me feel so much better !
now get out of here .
good night .
everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions , or leave in disguise after daybreak .
take a little vacation in mantua .
i'll find your servant , and he'll update you now and then on your case as it stands here .
give me your hand .
it's late .
farewell .
things have turned out so unluckily , sir , that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry you .
listen , she loved her cousin tybalt dearly , and so did i .
well , we were all born to die .
these times of pain are bad times for romance .
madam , good night .
give my regards to your daughter .
i will .
tonight she is shut up in her room , alone with her sadness .
sir paris , i'll make a desperate argument for my child's love .
tell her about my son paris's love for her .
and tell her , listen to me , on wednesday , wait , what day is today ?
monday , my lord .
monday !
ha , ha !
do you think it's a good idea to rush ?
we shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can invite a friend or two .
listen , because tybalt was just killed , people might think that we don't care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .
therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that's it .
what do you think about thursday ?
my lord , i wish thursday were tomorrow .
well go on home .
thursday it is , then .
are you going ?
it's still a long time until daybreak .
that sound you heard was the it was the lark , the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .
look , my love , what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east ?
night is over , and day is coming .
that light is not daylight , i know it .
it's some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to mantua .
so stay for a while .
you don't have to go yet .
let me be captured .
let me be put to death .
i am content , if that's the way you want it .
i want to stay more than i want to go .
come , death , and welcome !
let's talk .
it's not daylight .
it is , it is .
it's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise .
some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .
it's not true because she separates us .
more and more light .
more and more pain for us .
madam .
nurse ?
your mother is coming to your bedroom .
day has broken .
then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .
farewell , farewell !
give me one kiss , and i'll go down .
he locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .
my noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ?
i don't know , and he won't tell me .
have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason ?
i hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around .
are you gone like that , my love , my lord ?
oh , by this count i'll be many years older before i see my romeo again .
farewell !
i won't miss any chance to send my love to you .
oh , do you think we'll ever meet again ?
oh god , i have a soul that predicts evil things !
now that you are down there , you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb .
either my eyesight is failing me , or you look pale .
and trust me , love , you look pale to me too .
sadness takes away our color .
goodbye , goodbye !
oh luck , luck .
everyone says you can't make up your mind .
i hope maybe then you'll send him back home soon .
who's that calling ?
is it my mother ?
what strange reason could she have for coming here ?
what's going on , juliet ?
madam , i am not well .
will you cry about your cousin's death forever ?
are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ?
if you could , you couldn't bring him back to life .
so stop crying .
a little bit of grief shows a lot of love .
let me keep weeping for such a great loss .
you will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing .
feeling the loss like this , i can't help but weep for him forever .
well , girl , you're weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive .
what villain , madam ?
that villain , romeo .
that's because the murderer is alive .
yes , madam , he lies beyond my reach .
i wish that no one could avenge my cousin's death except me !
stop crying .
i'll send a man to mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .
and then , i hope , you'll be satisfied .
i'll never be satisfied with romeo until i see him .
madam , if you can find a man to deliver the poison , i'll mix it myself so that romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it .
i want to take the love i had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him .
find out the way , and i'll find the right man .
but now i have joyful news for you , girl .
and it's good to have joy in such a joyless time .
please tell me .
well , well , you have a careful father , child .
madam , tell me quickly , what day is that ?
indeed , my child , at saint peter's church early thursday morning , the gallant , young , and noble gentleman count paris will happily make you a joyful bride .
now , i swear by saint peter's church and peter too , he will not make me a joyful bride there .
how can i marry him , this husband , before he comes to court me ?
please , tell my father , madam , i won't marry yet .
and , when i do marry , i swear , it will be romeo , whom you know i hate , rather than paris .
that's really news !
here comes your father .
tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news .
what are you , girl ?
some kind of fountain ?
why are you still crying ?
have you told her our decision ?
i wish the fool were dead and married to her grave !
how can this be ?
isn't she proud of such a match ?
doesn't she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom ?
but i am thankful that you have found it .
what is this ?
what is this fuzzy logic ?
what is this ?
"i hear you say "" proud "" and "" i thank you , "" and then "" no thank you "" and "" not proud , "" you spoiled little girl ."
you disgust me , you little bug !
you worthless girl !
you pale face !
shame on you !
what , are you crazy ?
good father , i'm begging you on my knees , be patient and listen to me say just one thing .
don't say anything .
don't reply .
don't talk back to me .
she disgusts me , the little hussy !
god in heaven bless her !
my lord , you're wrong to berate her like that .
and why , wise lady ?
go blabber with your gossiping friends .
i've said nothing wrong .
oh , for god's sake .
can't i say something ?
be quiet , you mumbling fool !
we don't need to hear it .
you're getting too angry .
goddammit !
it makes me mad .
day and night , hour after hour , all the time , at work , at play , alone , in company , my top priority has always been to find her a husband .
thursday is coming .
put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice .
if you act like my daughter , i'll marry you to my friend .
think about it .
i won't break this promise .
delay this marriage for a month , or a week .
or , if you don't delay , make my wedding bed in the tomb where tybalt lies .
don't talk to me , because i won't say a word .
do as you please , because i'm done worrying about you .
oh god ! , oh nurse , how can this be stopped ?
my husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven .
how can i bring those promises back down to earth , unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven ?
give me comfort .
don't you have one word of joy ?
give me some comfort , nurse .
oh , he's a lovely gentleman !
romeo's a dishcloth compared to him .
madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of paris .
curse my very heart , but i think you should be happy in this second marriage , because it's better than your first .
even if it's not better , your first marriage is over .
are you speaking from your heart ?
amen !
what ?
well , you have given me great comfort .
i made my father angry , so i went to friar lawrence's cell to confess and be forgiven .
alright , i will .
oh , that most wicked fiend !
i'm going to the friar to find out his solution .
if everything else fails , at least i have the power to take my own life .
on thursday , sir ?
that's very soon .
you say you don't know what the girl thinks .
i don't like it .
now you know the reason for the rush .
look , sir , here comes the lady walking toward my cell .
i'm happy to meet you , my lady and my wife .
that might be the case sir ,
good morning , cousin .
is it that early in the day ?
it's only just now nine o'clock .
was that my father who left here in such a hurry ?
it was .
i don't have the thing that makes time fly .
you're in love ?
out .
out of love ?
so , where should we eat ?
"that "" may be "" must be , love , on thursday ."
what must be will be .
that is a certain truth .
have you come to make confession to this father ?
if i answered that question , i'd be making confession to you .
don't deny to him that you love me .
i'll confess to you that i love him .
you will also confess , i'm sure , that you love me .
if i do so , it will mean more if i say it behind your back than if i say it to your face .
you poor soul , your face has suffered many tears .
your face is mine , and you have slandered it .
i have time for you now , my sad daughter .
god forbid that i should prevent sacred devotion !
oh , juliet , i already know about your sad situation .
i hear that you must marry this count on thursday , and that nothing can delay it .
don't tell me that you've heard about this marriage , friar , unless you can tell me how to prevent it .
if you who are so wise can't help , please be kind enough to call my solution wise .
hold on , then .
tomorrow is wednesday .
tomorrow night make sure that you are alone .
don't let the nurse stay with you in your bedroom .
give me the vial .
give it to me !
love will give me strength , and strength will help me accomplish this plan .
goodbye , dear father .
you won't get any bad cooks from me .
how can you test them like that ?
so the cooks who can't lick their fingers aren't hired .
go , get out of here .
we're unprepared for this wedding celebration .
yes , that's true .
look , she's come home from confession with a happy look on her face .
holy father lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness .
send for the count .
go tell him about this .
i'll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning .
i met the young man at lawrence's cell .
well , i'm glad about this .
this is good .
stand up .
yes , alright , go , i say , and bring him here .
now , before god , our whole city owes this friar a great debt .
nurse , will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry i'll need to wear tomorrow ?
no , not until thursday .
there's plenty of time .
we'll have the wedding at the church tomorrow .
it's already almost night .
and everything will be alright , i promise you , wife .
you should go to juliet and dress her up .
i'm not going to bed tonight .
leave me alone .
i'll pretend to be the housewife for once .
yes , those are the best clothes .
what , are you busy ?
do you need my help ?
i'm sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities .
good night .
only god knows when we'll meet again .
in my desperate situation , i have to act alone .
alright , here's the vial .
what if this mixture doesn't work at all ?
will i be married tomorrow morning ?
lie down right there .
oh , look !
i think i see my cousin tybalt's ghost .
wait , tybalt , wait !
romeo , romeo , romeo !
here's a drink .
i drink to you .
no , cousin , i'm crying .
good man , why are you crying ?
yes , this is what love does .
what else is love ?
it's a sweet lozenge that you choke on .
goodbye , cousin .
wait .
i'll come with you .
if you leave me like this , you're doing me wrong .
i'm not myself .
i'm not here .
tell me seriously , who is the one you love ?
you mean i should groan and tell you ?
groan ?
no .
but tell me seriously who it is .
take these keys and get more spices , nurse .
they're calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen .
come on , wake up , wake up , wake up !
the second cock crowed .
the curfew-bell rang .
don't worry about the cost .
go , you old housewife , go .
go to bed , dear .
you'll be sick tomorrow because you've stayed up all night .
i've stayed up all night many times before for less important matters , and i've never gotten sick .
yes , you've been a ladies ' man in your time .
a jealous woman , a jealous woman !
now , fellow , what have you got there ?
hurry up , hurry up .
i'm smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering peter .
right , and well said .
that guy's funny .
goodness , it's daylight .
wife !
what ?
hey , nurse !
go wake juliet .
go and get her dressed .
i'll go and chat with paris .
hey , hurry up , hurry up !
the bridegroom is already here .
hurry up , i say .
mistress !
hey , mistress !
i bet she's fast asleep .
hey , lady !
hey , love , i say !
madam !
sweetheart !
hey , bride !
what , you don't say a word ?
you take your beauty sleep now .
how sound asleep she is !
yes , let the count take you in your bed .
he'll wake you up , i bet .
won't he ?
what's all the noise in here ?
oh , sad day !
what is the matter ?
look , look !
oh , what a sad day !
oh my , oh my !
my child , my reason for living , wake up , look up , or i'll die with you !
for shame , bring juliet out here .
her bridegroom is here .
she's dead , deceased , she's dead .
curse the day !
curse the day !
she's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
no !
let me see her .
oh no !
she's cold .
her blood has stopped , and her joints are stiff .
she's been dead for some time .
she's dead , like a beautiful flower , killed by an unseasonable frost .
oh , sad day !
oh , this is a painful time !
death , which has taken her away to make me cry , now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak .
come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
she's ready to go , but she'll never return .
death is my son-in-law .
death is my heir .
my daughter married death .
i will die and leave death everything .
life , wealth , everything belongs to death .
have i waited so long to see this morning , only to see this ?
accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
this is the most miserable hour of all time !
i had only one child , one poor child , one poor and loving child , the one thing i had to rejoice and comfort myself , and cruel death has stolen it from me !
oh pain !
oh painful , painful , painful day !
there has never been so black a day as today .
oh painful day , oh painful day !
she was tricked , divorced , wronged , spited , killed !
cruel , cruel death killed her .
oh love !
oh life !
there is no life , but my love is dead !
despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
why did this have to happen now ?
my soul and not my child !
you are dead !
be quiet , for shame !
the cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming .
you had this child with the help of heaven .
now heaven has her .
she is in a better place .
you could not prevent her from dying someday , but heaven will give her eternal life .
the most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder , that was your idea of heaven .
and now you cry , even though she has risen up above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
oh , in this love , you love your child so badly , that you go mad , even though she is in heaven .
it is best to marry well and die young , better than to be married for a long time .
our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast .
our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches .
everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave .
don't disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven's will .
well , we can put away our pipes and go home .
yes , well , things could get better .
no , not a sad song .
it's not the right time to play .
you won't , then ?
no .
then i'll really give it to you .
what will you give us ?
no money , i swear .
i'll call you a minstrel .
then i'll call you a serving-creature .
then i'll smack you on the head with the serving-creature's knife .
i'll make you sing .
do you hear me ?
answer me like men .
well , sir , because silver has a sweet sound .
another studpid answer !
what do you say , james well , i don't know what to say .
i'll answer for you .
"it is "" music with her silver sound , "" because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds ."
what an annoying man , this guy is !
forget about him , jack !
if i can trust my dreams , then some joyful news is coming soon .
oh my !
how sweet it would be to actually have the woman i love , when merely thinking about love makes me so happy .
do you have news from verona ! , what is it , balthasar ?
do you bring me a letter from the friar ?
how is my wife ?
is my father well ?
how is my juliet ?
i ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well .
then she is well , and nothing is wrong .
her body sleeps in the capulet tomb , and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven .
i saw her buried in her family's tomb , and then i came here to tell you the news .
oh , pardon me for bringing this bad news , but you told me it was my job , sir .
"you wouldn't tell a sick man he "" seriously "" has to make his will , it would just make him worse ."
seriously , cousin , i love a woman .
then you were right on target .
the woman i love is beautiful .
a beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest .
well , you're not on target there .
yes she has , and by keeping celibate , she wastes her beauty .
she's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair .
take my advice .
don't think about her .
teach me to forget to think !
is it really true ?
then i rebel against you , stars !
you know where i live .
get me some ink and paper , and hire some horses to ride .
i will leave here for verona tonight .
please , sir , have patience .
you look pale and wild as if you're going to hurt yourself .
tsk , you're wrong .
leave me and do what i told you to do .
don't you have a letter for me from the friar ?
no , my good lord .
no matter .
get on your way and hire those horses .
i'll be with you right away .
well , juliet , i'll lie with you tonight .
let's see how .
destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men !
as i remember , this should be the house .
today's a holiday , so the beggar's shop is shut .
hey !
pharmacist !
who's that calling so loud ?
come here , man .
i see that you are poor .
here are forty ducats .
you're this poor and wretched and still afraid to die ?
your cheeks are thin because of hunger .
i can see in your eyes that you're starving .
the world is not your friend , and neither is the law .
the world doesn't make laws to make you rich .
i pay you because you're poor , not because you want me to buy this .
holy franciscan friar !
brother , hey !
that sounds like the voice of friar john .
welcome back from mantua .
what does romeo say ?
or , if he wrote down his thoughts , give me his letter .
i couldn't go to mantua because i was stuck there .
then who took my letter to romeo ?
unhappy fortune !
brother , i'll go and bring it to you .
now i must go to the tomb alone .
within three hours juliet will wake up .
but i'll write again to mantua , and i'll keep her in my cell until romeo comes .
she's shut inside a dead man's tomb !
give me your torch , boy .
go away and stay apart from me .
put the torch out , so i can't be seen .
give me those flowers .
do as i tell you .
go .
the boy is warning me that someone approaches .
who's ruining my rituals of true love ?
it's someone with a torch !
i must hide in the darkness for awhile .
give me that pickax and the crowbar .
i'll go , sir , and i won't bother you .
that's the way to show me friendship .
take this .
good and noble young man , don't mess with someone who's desperate .
get away from here and leave me .
think about the ones who have died .
let them put fear in your heart .
please , young man , don't make me angry .
oh , go away !
don't stay here , go away .
live , and from now on , say a madman mercifully told you to run away .
i'm arresting you as a criminal .
are you going to provoke me ?
alright , let's fight , boy !
oh lord , they're fighting !
i'll go call the watch .
alright , i will .
it's mercutio's relative , noble count paris !
what did my man say ?
i think he told me paris was about to marry juliet .
isn't that what he said ?
or was i dreaming ?
i'll bury you in a magnificent grave .
a grave ?
oh no !
juliet lies here , and her beauty fills this tomb with light .
death has sucked the honey from your breath , but it has not yet ruined your beauty .
you haven't been conquered .
oh , what better favor can i do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young .
should i believe that death is in love with you , and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress ?
here , here i'll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids .
oh , i'll rest here forever .
eyes , look out for the last time !
arms , make your last embrace !
his drugs work quickly .
so i die with a kiss .
look at other beautiful girls .
saint francis , help me !
how often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones !
i'm a friend , a friend who knows you well .
god bless you !
tell me , my good friend , what is that light over there ?
it looks to me like it's burning in the capulet tomb .
who is it ?
romeo .
how long has he been there ?
for a full half hour .
go with me to the tomb .
i don't dare , sir .
stay , then .
i'll go alone .
i'm suddenly afraid .
oh , i'm very scared something awful has happened .
as i slept under this yew-tree here , i had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him .
what is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb ?
oh friendly friar !
where is my husband ?
i remember very well where i should be , and here i am .
where is my romeo ?
i hear some noise .
lady , come out of the tomb .
a greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan .
come , come away .
your husband lies dead there , and paris too .
come , i'll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns .
it's a cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
poison , i see , has been the cause of his death .
i will kiss your lips .
perhaps there's still some poison on them , to make me die with a medicinal kiss .
oh , noise ?
then i'll be quick .
oh , good , a knife !
rust inside my body and let me die .
this is the place .
there , where the torch is burning .
the ground is bloody .
this is a pitiful sight !
go , tell the prince .
run to the capulets .
wake up the montagues .
have some others search .
here's romeo's man .
we found him in the churchyard .
hold him in custody until the prince gets here .
here is a friar who's trembling , sighing and weeping .
we took this pickax and this shovel from him , as he was walking from this side of the graveyard .
very suspicious .
hold the friar too .
what crimes happen so early in the morning that i have to wake up before the usual time ?
what's the problem , that they cry out so loud ?
"some people in the street are crying "" romeo . "" some are crying "" juliet , "" and some are crying "" paris . "" they're all running in an open riot toward our tomb ."
investigate how this foul murder came about .
oh heavens !
oh wife , look at how our daughter bleeds !
that knife should be in its sheath on that montague's back , but instead it's mis-sheathed in my daughter's breast .
oh my !
this sight of death is like a bell that warns me i'm old and i'll die soon .
oh , my liege , my wife died tonight .
sadness over my son's exile stopped her breath .
what further pain must i endure in my old age ?
look , and you'll see .
and then i'll be the leader of pain , and maybe i'll lead you as far as death .
in the meantime , hold on , and be patient .
i am the greatest , but i was able to do the least .
i have already condemned and excused myself .
tell us what you know about this affair .
i will be brief because i'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story .
in the meantime i wrote to romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off .
i know all of this .
i brought my master news of juliet's death .
give me the letter .
oh , brother montague , give me your hand .
but what do you say to my request ?
i can only repeat what i've said before .
my daughter is still very young .
she's not even fourteen years old .
girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers .
girls who marry so young grow up too soon .
but go ahead and charm her , gentle paris ; make her love you .
tonight i'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years .
at my humble house tonight , you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below .
in the beautiful city of verona , where our story takes place , a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence , and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .
two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide .
their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents ' feud .
come along with me .
find the people whose names are on this list ?
it is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others ' tools , that fisherman should play with paints , and painters should play with with fishing nets .
but i've been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list , and i can't read !
but here come some people , right in the nick of time .
for when you cut your shin .
what ?
romeo , are you crazy ?
i'm locked up in a prison and deprived of food .
i'm whipped and tortured , may god give you a good evening .
excuse me , sir , do you know how to read ?
i can read my own fortune in my misery .
perhaps you've learned from life and not from books .
but please tell me , can you read anything you see ?
yes , if i know the language and the letters .
i see .
well , that's an stay , fellow .
i can read .
signor martino and his wife and daughters , count anselme and his beautiful sisters , vitruvio's widow , signor placentio and his lovely nieces , mercutio and his brother valentine , my uncle capulet and his wife and daughters , my fair niece rosaline and livia ,
"signor valentio and his cousin tybalt , lucio and the lively helena . "" that's a nice group of people ."
where are they supposed to come ?
up .
where ?
to supper ?
to our house .
whose house ?
my master's house .
indeed , i should have asked you before who he was .
now i'll tell you so you don't have to ask .
my master is the great and rich capulet , and if you don't belong to the house of montague , please come and drink a cup of wine .
have a nice day !
the beautiful rosaline whom you love so much will be at capulet's traditional feast , along with every beautiful woman in verona .
go there and compare her objectively to some other girls i'll show you .
a woman more beautiful than the one i love ?
the sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began .
i'll go with you .
nurse , where's my daughter ?
tell her to come to me .
i swear to you by my virginity at age twelve , i already told her to come .
come on !
who's calling me ?
your mother .
madam , i'm here .
what do you want ?
you know how young my daughter is .
yes , i know her age down to the hour .
she's not even fourteen .
i'd bet fourteen of my own teeth , but , i'm sorry to say , i only have four teeth , she's not fourteen .
whether it's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of lammas eve , she'll be fourteen .
she and susan , god rest her and all christian souls , were born on the same day .
well , susan died and is with god .
she was too good for me .
but like i said , on the night of lammas eve , she will be fourteen .
yes , she will .
indeed , i remember it well .
it's been eleven years since the earthquake .
i had put bitter wormwood on my breast as i was sitting in the sun , under the wall of the dovehouse .
but like i said , when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple , the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast .
then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake .
there was no need to tell me to get out of there .
"oh , "" he said , "" did you fall on your face ?"
you'll enough of this .
please be quiet .
yes , madam .
"but i can't help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said , "" yes . "" i swear , she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster's testicle ."
it was a painful bruise , and she was crying bitterly .
"yes , "" said my husband , "" did you fall on your face ?"
"you'll fall backward when you grow up , won't you , jule ? "" and she stopped crying and said , "" yes . "" now you stop too , nurse , please ."
may god choose you to receive his grace .
you were the prettiest baby i ever nursed .
if i live to see you get married someday , all my wishes will come true .
tell me , my daughter juliet , what is your attitude about getting married ?
it is an honor that i do not dream of .
well , start thinking about marriage now .
here in verona there are girls younger than you , girls from noble families , who have already become mothers .
by my count , i was already your mother at just about your age , while you remain a virgin .
well then , i'll say this quickly : the valiant paris wants you as his bride .
what a man , young lady .
summertime in verona has no flower as fine as him .
lose nothing ?
i'll look at him and try to like him , at least if what i see is likable .
but i won't let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows .
everything's out of control .
please , follow straight after me .
we'll follow you .
go , girl , look for a man who'll give you happy nights at the end of happy days .
what will we say is our excuse for being here ?
or should we enter without apologizing ?
it's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that .
let them judge us however they please .
give me a torch .
i don't want to dance .
no , noble romeo , you've got to dance .
not me , believe me .
you're wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles .
my soul is made out of lead , and it's so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so i can't move .
you're a lover .
take cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man .
his arrow has pierced me too deeply , so i can't fly high with his cheerful feathers .
i sink under the heavy weight of love .
we won't take their garbage .
i hit hard when i'm angry .
angry enough to run away .
you won't stand and fight .
a dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand .
if you sink , you're dragging love down .
is love really tender ?
i think it's too rough , too rude , too rowdy , and it pricks like a thorn .
if love plays rough with you , play rough with come on , let's knock and go in .
let playful people with light hearts dance .
come on , we're wasting precious daylight .
let's go !
no we're not , it's night .
we mean well by going to this masquerade ball , but it's not smart of us to go .
why , may i ask ?
i had a dream last night .
so did i .
well , what was your dream ?
my dream told me that dreamers often lie .
they lie in bed while they dream about the truth .
oh , then i see you've been with who's queen mab ?
sometimes she rides over a courtier's lips , and he dreams of making money off of someone .
sometimes she tickles a priest's nose with a enough , enough !
mercutio , be quiet .
the wind you're talking about is blowing us off our course .
dinner is over , and we're going to get there too late .
onward , lover boys !
beat the drum .
where's potpan ?
when only one or two men have all the good manners , and even they are dirty , things are bad .
take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates .
you , good friend , save me a piece of marzipan , and if you love me , have the porter let in susan grindstone and nell .
yes , boy , i'm ready .
they're looking for you in the great chamber .
we can't be in two places at once , both here and there !
cheers , boys .
be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything .
welcome , gentlemen .
whichever of you acts shy , i'll swear she has corns .
welcome , gentlemen .
i swear , it must be thirty years .
it's been longer , it's been longer .
lucentio's son is older than that , sir .
he's thirty years old .
are you really going to tell me that ?
his son was a minor only two years ago .
i don't know , sir .
oh , she shows the torches how to burn bright !
my eyes were liars , then , because i never saw true beauty before tonight .
i can tell by his voice that this man is a montague .
why are you acting so angry ?
uncle , this man is a montague , our enemy .
is it young romeo ?
that's him , that villain romeo .
calm down , gentle cousin .
leave him alone .
he carries himself like a dignified gentleman , and , to tell you the truth , he has a reputation throughout verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man .
i wouldn't insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town .
so calm down .
just ignore him .
i won't tolerate him .
you but , uncle , we're being disrespected .
go on , go on .
you're an insolent little boy .
is that how it is , really ?
i know what i'll do .
you have to contradict me , do you ?
i'll teach you a lesson .
don't saints and pilgrims have lips too ?
yes , pilgrim , they have lips that they're supposed to pray with .
well then , saint , let lips do what hands do .
please grant my prayer so my faith doesn't turn to despair .
saints don't move , even when they grant prayers .
then don't move while i act out my prayer .
now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours .
then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours ?
sin from my lips ?
give me my sin back .
you kiss like you've studied how .
madam , your mother wants to talk to you .
who is her mother ?
i nursed her daughter , whom you were just talking to .
let me tell you , the man who marries her will become very wealthy .
no gentlemen , don't get ready to go now .
we have a little dessert coming up .
you're right .
the fight is between our masters , and we men who work for them .
it's all the same .
i'll be a harsh master to them .
cut off their heads ?
you mean their cut off their heads , take their maidenheads , whatever .
take my remark in whichever sense you like .
"the women you rape are the ones who'll have to "" sense "" it ."
everybody knows i'm a nice piece of flesh .
it's a good thing you're not a piece of fish .
you're pull out your tool now .
i have my naked sword out .
come over here , nurse .
who is that gentleman ?
he is the son and heir of old tiberio .
who's the one who's going out the door right now ?
well , that one , i think , is young petruchio .
i don't know his name .
go ask .
what's this ?
what's this ?
the strangers are all gone .
but he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy .
and juliet's just as much in love as he , but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover .
but love gives them power , and time gives them the chance to meet , sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure .
can i go away while my heart stays here ?
i bet he slipped away and went home to bed .
he ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall .
call to him , mercutio .
i'll conjure him as if i were summoning a spirit .
romeo !
show yourself in the form of a sigh .
speak one rhyme , and i'll be satisfied .
"just cry out , "" ah me ! "" just say "" love "" and "" dove . "" say just one lovely word to my good friend"
if he hears you , you'll make him angry .
what i'm saying can't anger him .
the things i'm saying are fair and honest .
his love is blind , so it belongs in the dark .
if love is blind , it can't hit the target .
now he'll sit under a let's go .
there's no point in looking for him if he doesn't want to be found .
it is the east , and juliet is the sun .
virginity makes her look sick and green .
let it go .
oh , there's my lady !
oh , it is my love .
oh , i wish she knew how much i love her .
she's talking , but she's not saying anything .
so what ?
her eyes are saying something .
she's not talking to me .
two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business , and they're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return .
if her eyes were in the night sky , they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing , thinking her light was the light of day .
look how she leans her hand on her cheek .
oh , i wish i was the glove on that hand so that i could touch that cheek .
oh , my !
who are you ?
i hate my name , dear saint , because my name is your enemy .
aren't you romeo ?
and aren't you a montague ?
tell me , how did you get in here ?
and why did you come ?
if any of my relatives find you here they'll kill you because of who you are .
therefore your relatives are no obstacle .
if they see you , they'll murder you .
just look at me kindly , and i'm invincible against their hatred .
i'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here .
i'd rather they killed me than have to live without your love .
otherwise , you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight .
do you love me ?
"i know you'll say "" yes , "" and i'll believe you ."
what should i swear by ?
don't swear at all .
but if you have to swear , swear by your wonderful self , which is the god i worship like an idol , and then i'll believe you .
if my heart's dear love , well , don't swear .
although you bring me joy , i can't take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .
our love , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .
i hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest i feel in my heart .
oh , are you going to leave me so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction could you possibly have tonight ?
i pledged my love to you before you asked me to .
yet i wish i could take that promise back , so i had it to give again .
you would take it back ?
why would you do that , my love ?
only to be generous and give it to you once more .
but i'm wishing for something i already have .
my generosity to you is as limitless as the sea , and my love is as deep .
i hear a noise inside .
sweet montague , be true .
stay here for a moment .
i'll come back .
oh , blessed , blessed night !
because it's dark out , i'm afraid all this is just a dream , too sweet to be real .
three words , dear romeo , and then it's good night for real .
don't worry about me .
i let's not break the law by starting a fight .
let them start something .
i'll frown at them as they pass by , and they can react however they want .
you mean however they dare .
i'll bite my thumb at them .
hey , are you biting your thumb at us ?
i'm biting my thumb .
are you biting your thumb at us ?
are you trying to start a fight ?
start a fight ?
no , sir .
tomorrow i'll send the messenger .
my soul depends on it , a thousand times good night .
leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you .
oh , i wish i could make a my soul is calling out my name .
the sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet .
romeo !
my baby hawk ?
what time tomorrow should i send a messenger to you ?
by nine o'clock .
i won't fail .
from now until then seems like twenty years .
i have forgotten why i called you back .
let me stand here until you remember your reason .
i'll forget that i have any home besides this spot right here .
it's almost morning .
he lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string .
i wish i was your bird .
my sweet , so do i .
but i would kill you by petting you too much .
good night , good night .
parting is such sweet sorrow that i'll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow .
i hope you sleep peacefully .
i wish i were sleep and peace , so i could spend the night with you .
now i'll go see my priest , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck .
darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a drunk man .
now , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , i have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .
the earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb .
from the earth's womb , many different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment .
herbs , plants , and stones possess great power .
there is nothing on earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality .
virtue turns to vice if it's misused .
inside the little rind of this weak flower , there is both poison and powerful medicine .
there are two opposite elements in everything , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .
when evil is dominant , death soon kills the body like cancer .
good morning , father .
god bless you .
who greets me so early in the morning ?
young man , something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early .
every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , but young men shouldn't have a care in the world .
they should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep .
therefore , the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've been upset with some anxiety .
if that's not the case , then this must be the answer : you , romeo , have not been to bed tonight .
your last guess is right .
i enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep .
with rosaline , father ?
that's good , my boy .
but where have you been ?
i'll tell you before you have to ask me again .
you have the sacred power to cure both of us .
i carry no hatred , holy man , because my request will benefit my enemy .
